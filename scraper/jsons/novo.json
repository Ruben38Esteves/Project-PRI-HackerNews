allies.</p>\n<p>The agency, in collaboration with the National Engineering Laboratory for Computer Virus Prevention Technology, went on to accuse the U.S. federal government, intelligence agencies, and Five Eyes countries of conducting cyber espionage activities against China, France, Germany, Japan, and internet users globally.</p>\n<p>It also said there's \"ironclad evidence\" indicating that the U.S. carries out false flag operations in an attempt to conceal its own malicious cyber attacks, adding it's inventing the \"so-called danger of Chinese cyber attacks\" and that it has established a \"large-scale global internet surveillance network.\"</p>\n<p>\"And the fact that the U.S. adopted supply chain attacks, implanted backdoors in internet products and 'pre-positioned' has completely debunked the Volt Typhoon \u2013 a political farce written, directed, and acted by the U.S. federal government,\" it <a href=\"https://www.cverc.org.cn/head/zhaiyao/news20241014-FTTFSAN.htm\"

base in Guam</a> has not been a victim of the Volt Typhoon cyber attacks at all, but the initiator of a large number of cyberattacks against China and many Southeast Asian countries and the backhaul center of stolen data.\"</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/chinese-hackers-target-taiwan-and-us.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous report</a> published by CVERC in July <a href=\"https://www.cverc.org.cn/head/zhaiyao/news20240708-FTTFER.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">characterized</a> the Volt Typhoon actor as a <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202408/1318188.shtml\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misinformation campaign</a> orchestrated by the U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>Volt Typhoon is the moniker assigned to a China-nexus cyber espionage group that's believed to be active since 2019, stealthily embedding itself into critical infrastructure networks by <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/after-fbi-takedown-kv-botnet-operators.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">routing traffic through edge devices</a> comprising routers, firewalls, and VPN hardware in an effort to blend in and fly under the radar.</p>\n<p>As recently as late August 2024, it was linked to the <a

Director (CVE-2024-39717, CVSS score: 6.6) to deliver a web shell named VersaMem for facilitating credential theft and run arbitrary code.</p>\n<p>The use of edge devices by China-linked intrusion sets has become <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/researchers-identify-multiple-china.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">something</a> of a <a

href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/china-backed-hackers-exploit-fortinet.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent years</a>, with some campaigns leveraging them as Operational Relay Boxes (<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/cybersecurity-agencies-warn-of-china.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ORBs</a>) to evade detection.</p>\n<p>This is substantiated by a recent report published by French cybersecurity company Sekoia, which attributed threat actors likely of Chinese origin to a wide-range attack campaign that infects edge devices like routers and cameras to deploy backdoors such as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-gobrat-remote-access-trojan.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GobRAT</a> and Bulbature for follow-on attacks against targets of interest.</p>\n<p>\"Bulbature, an implant that was not yet documented in open source, seems to be only used to transform the compromised edge device into an ORB to relay attacks against final victims networks,\" the researchers <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/bulbature-beneath-the-waves-of-gobrat/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>\"This architecture, consisting of compromised edge devices acting as ORBs, allows an operator to carry out offensive cyber operations around the world near to the final targets and hide its location by creating on-demand proxies tunnels.\"</p>\n<p>In the latest 59-page document, Chinese authorities said more than 50 security experts from the U.S., Europe, and Asia reached out to the CVERC, expressing concerns related to \"the U.S. false narrative\" about Volt Typhoon and the lack of evidence linking the threat actor to China.</p>\n\n<p>The CVERC, however, did not name those experts, nor their reasons to back up the hypothesis. It further went on to state that the U.S. intelligence agencies created a stealthy toolkit dubbed Marble no later than 2015 with the intent to confuse attribution efforts.</p>\n<p>\"The toolkit is a tool framework that can be integrated with other cyber weapon development projects to assist cyber weapon developers in obfuscating various identifiable features in program code, effectively 'erasing' the 'fingerprints' of cyber weapon developers,\" it said.</p>\n<p>\"What's more, the framework has a more 'shameless' function to insert strings in other languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Persian, and Arabic, which is obviously intended to mislead investigators and frame China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Arab countries.\"</p>\n<p>The report further takes the opportunity to accuse the U.S. of relying on its \"innate technological advantages and geological advantages in the construction of the internet\" to control fiber optic cables across the Atlantic and the Pacific and using them for \"indiscriminate monitoring\" of internet users worldwide.</p>\n<p>It also alleged that companies like Microsoft and CrowdStrike have resorted to giving \"absurd\" monikers with \"obvious geopolitical overtones\" for threat activity groups with names like \"typhoon,\" \"panda,\" and \"dragon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Again, we would like to call for extensive international collaboration in this field,\" it concluded. \"Moreover, cybersecurity companies and research institutions should focus on counter-cyber threat technology research and better products and services for users.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Protect yourself by removing unused extensions, checking their permissions, and only allowing them to run on specific sites. Enable \"Click to activate\" for more control, and use tools like Chrome's Extension Source Viewer to spot any suspicious behavior. Keep extensions updated, monitor network traffic for unusual activity, and consider using a separate browser for sensitive tasks. Features like Firefox's Temporary Container Tabs can also help by isolating extension access. These simple steps can keep your browsing safer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>And that's how the cybersecurity cookie crumbles this week! But listen, before you log off and chill, remember this: always double-check the sender's email address before clicking any links, even if it looks like it's from your bestie or your bank.

The latest advisory, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-242a\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AA24-242A</a>, describes a new cybercriminal group and its attack methods. It also details three important actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from ransomware \u2013 Installing updates as soon as they are released, requiring phishing-resistant MFA (i.e. non-SMS text-based), and training users.</em></p>\n<p>The growth in the number of victims of ransomware attacks and data breaches has become so profound that the new cyber defense challenge is just keeping up with the number of new attacks and disclosures from victims. This is the product of stunning advancements in cybercriminal attack methods combined with a too-slow response by many organizations in adjusting to new attack methods. As predicted, Generative AI has indeed been a game changer for cybercriminals attacking organizations and it mandates urgent adjustments to cyber defense strategies. </p>\n<p>Through this remarkable transformation in threats, one thing that hasn't changed is the inherent human limitations of everyday users and this is why they are the preferred target for cybercriminals. No amount of training will ever imbue the average user with the super-skills required to detect advanced phishing campaigns or sophisticated deep fakes. </p>\n<p>To understand the impact, Token set out to collect perspectives on this pressing subject from cybersecurity leaders in their own words. To accomplish this, Token commissioned Datos Insights, a leading global data and advisory services firm for this research study that reveals the insights and perspectives of leading CISOs and workforce MFA leaders across the U.S. Datos Insights ditched the overused multiple choice questionnaire approach and conducted qualitative 60-minute video interviews to examine CISO perspectives in depth. In this article, we will examine the valuable insights gained from the research.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>CISOs are unanimous that user vulnerabilities are their number one risk</strong></h2>\n<p>Attack vectors are advancing in sophistication through the adoption of artificial intelligence capabilities, specifically generative AI, making them more difficult for CISOs and their teams to defend against. Cybercriminals most frequently target employees at large organizations through phishing attacks to gain network access. CISA reports that 90% of ransomware attacks are the result of phishing. </p>\n<style> .xm_container {display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 20px 10px 30px 0; background: #f9fbff; color: #160755; padding: 0 5%; border: 2px solid #d9deff; border-radius: 10px; text-align: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 #e2ebff; -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-topleft: 25px; -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 25px;} .ebook-image { flex: 0 0 200px; margin-right: 20px; } .ebook-details { flex: 1; }.ebook-details ul { margin: 15px; } .ebook-details ul li { margin-bottom: 5px; } @media (max-width: 600px) { .xm_container { flex-direction: column; } .ebook-image { margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; } } </style> \n<p>Advanced Phishing Attacks remain the most effective tool in a hacker's arsenal. These attacks have become more targeted and sophisticated with the use of Gen AI. Gen AI also enables the launching of spear phishing attacks targeted at specific individuals within an organization on a large scale and with greater detail, leveraging real data about the organization and its employees to appear authentic. The tell-tale signs of phishing emails are rapidly disappearing as these emails are increasingly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This will soon negate the value of user training.</p>\n<p>The above is further compounded by the rise of <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/blog/deepfakes-interactive-deepfakes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deepfake technology</a> as Gen AI has given birth to new forms of social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals are now using AI-generated voices and videos to impersonate executives and other trusted individuals. These are being executed via phone calls from trusted phone numbers that are spoofed by the attackers and via Zoom conference calls where cybercriminals impersonate known and trusted colleagues. Attackers have been successful in convincing employees to transfer funds, share credentials, and perform other actions that can compromise security. These attacks exploit the inherent trust that employees place in familiar voices and faces, making them exceptionally dangerous. </p>\n<p>The tools to conduct these attacks are now available to billions on the dark web with no specialized skills required. Phishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive realm of expert cybercriminals, but with the advent of generative AI and new cybercrime tools, launching these attacks has become accessible to anyone with access to the dark web, which is anyone with a computing device and an internet connection. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and AI-driven tools available on the dark web have simplified the process, eliminating the need for advanced skills. This shift enables individuals with minimal technical knowledge to execute sophisticated cyberattacks with just a computer and internet connection. The gig economy meets the next generation of cyber attacks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>New attacks require new defense strategies</strong></h2>\n<p>Phishing-Resistant MFA Adoption is critical and no longer a nice to have. With phishing attacks as the top cyber threat for enterprises, legacy MFA is being proven increasingly inadequate as the numbers of victims substantiate. Many legacy MFA solutions are decades-old technology. The current report highlights the urgency of deploying phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA solutions, especially in the face of AI-enhanced phishing attacks. CISOs should accelerate the shift toward MFA solutions that are hardware-based, use biometrics, and are FIDO compliant. These significantly mitigate phishing and ransomware attacks and would have prevented the overwhelming majority of current ransomware attacks saving organizations a combined billions of dollars in losses in the last year alone. </p>\n<p>Next-generation MFA is best implemented with targeted deployments for privileged users. The report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the deployment of next-generation MFA to high-risk users within the enterprise, particularly systems administrators and executives. CISOs need to improve risk management for System Administrators despite having privileged access management (PAM) solutions. \"PAM solutions have functioned as the historical norm for CISOs managing system admin risks.\" The rise of phishing and insider attacks necessitates that CISOs prioritize MFA upgrade deployments at this important business risk. The report found that senior executives at many firms lack robust security solutions aligned with their business functions and business risk. Almost none of the CISOs interviewed had distinct controls deployed for their executive users. With spear-phishing and other techniques on the rise, this gap was unexpected and troubling.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The techniques used by cybercriminals are constantly evolving, but never so rapidly as over the past twelve months. We have surpassed the capacity of our users to be our first line of cyber defense and we have not given them any new tools beyond those developed years or decades ago. By staying informed about the latest threats and implementing a multi-layered defense strategy that emphasizes upgrading to phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA, organizations can protect their users' identities and stop cybercriminals from gaining unauthorized access to data and sensitive operations. Protecting your users from new attacks requires vigilance, education, and the right tools. By prioritizing these areas, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Token's Next-Generation MFA can stop phishing and ransomware from harming your organization at <a href=\"https://www.tokenring.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tokenring.com</a></p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It's worth pointing out that the LNK files are distributed within ZIP archives that are disguised as pirated movies.</p>\n<p>The LNK file connects to a content delivery network (CDN) hosting an obfuscated memory-only JavaScript dropper. The dropper subsequently executes the PEAKLIGHT PowerShell downloader script on the host, which then reaches out to a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch additional payloads.</p>\n\n<p>Mandiant said it identified different variations of the LNK files, some of which leverage asterisks (*) as wildcards to launch the legitimate mshta.exe binary to discreetly run malicious code (i.e., the dropper) retrieved from a remote server.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the droppers have been found to embed both hex-encoded and Base64-encoded PowerShell payloads that are eventually unpacked to execute PEAKLIGHT, which is designed to deliver next-stage malware on a compromised system while simultaneously downloading a legitimate movie trailer, likely as a ruse.</p>\n<p>\"PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths,\" Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said.</p>\n<p>\"If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site and download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.\"</p>\n<p>This is not the first time users searching for pirated movies have been targeted by malware.

It was discovered by the company in April 2024.</p>\n<p>\"FrostyGoop is an ICS-specific malware written in Golang that can interact directly with Industrial Control Systems (ICS) using Modbus TCP over port 502,\" researchers Kyle O'Meara, Magpie (Mark) Graham, and Carolyn Ahlers <a href=\"https://hub.dragos.com/hubfs/Reports/Dragos-FrostyGoop-ICS-Malware-Intel-Brief-0724_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.</p>\n<p>It's believed that the malware, mainly designed to target Windows systems, has been used to target ENCO controllers with TCP port 502 exposed to the internet. It has not been tied to any previously identified threat actor or activity cluster.</p>\n\n<p>FrostyGoop comes with capabilities to read and write to an ICS device holding registers containing inputs, outputs, and configuration data. It also accepts optional command line execution arguments, uses JSON-formatted configuration files to specify target IP addresses and Modbus commands, and logs output to a console and/or a JSON file.</p>\n<p>The incident targeting the municipal district energy company is said to have resulted in a loss of heating services to more than 600 apartment buildings for almost 48 hours.</p>\n<p>\"The adversaries sent Modbus commands to ENCO controllers, causing inaccurate measurements and system malfunctions,\" the researchers said in a conference call, noting initial access was likely gained by exploiting an unknown vulnerability in a publicly-accessible Mikrotik router in April 2023.</p>\n<p>\"The adversaries sent Modbus commands to ENCO controllers, causing inaccurate measurements and system malfunctions. Remediation took almost two days.\"</p>\n<p>While FrostyGoop extensively employs the Modbus protocol for client/server communications, it's far from the only one.

        "contents": "\n<h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>\n<p>The \"2024 Attack Intelligence Report\" from the staff at Rapid7 [1] is a well-researched, well-written report that is worthy of careful study. Some key takeaways are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>53% of the over 30 new vulnerabilities that were widely exploited in 2023 and at the start of 2024 were <em>zero-days</em>.</li>\n<li>More mass compromise events arose from zero-day vulnerabilities than from n-day vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Nearly a quarter of widespread attacks were zero-day attacks where a single adversary compromised dozens to hundreds of organizations simultaneously.</li>\n<li>Attackers are moving from initial access to exploitation in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So the conventional patch and put strategy is as effective as a firetruck showing up after a building has burned to the ground! Of course, patch and put could prevent future attacks, but taking into account that patch development takes from days to weeks [2] and that the average time to apply critical patches is 16 days [3], devices are vulnerable for a long time after the zero-day has become public knowledge. This allows smaller actors to get their share of the meat, much like the vultures they are. In view of Rapid7's report, something different must be done to protect IoT and other vulnerable devices.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Firmware Comes To Be</strong></h2>\n<p>\"Software Bills of Materials for IoT and OT devices\" by IoTSF is another excellent read. I was surprised to learn that \"Modern software is rarely created from scratch but rather it integrates a relatively small amount of new code with tens, hundreds, or even thousands of pre-existing components \u2026\". In the old days (circa 2015) we wrote our own firmware, but not anymore. Now, according to the authors, IoT firmware is assembled from mostly open source components that are riddled with vulnerabilities. This is not a step forward for device security!</p>\n<p>According to the IoTSF authors, components bring in more components, each with more vulnerabilities. Also according to them, creating accurate SBOMs is difficult, and identifying all of the vulnerabilities in an SBOM is even more difficult. So security teams are faced with inadequate SBOMs and the task of deciding which vulnerabilities are exploitable, then fixing those vulnerabilities. According to other reports, the number of vulnerabilities and the complexity of IoT firmware are growing rapidly year by year. Keeping up with patches seems to be a hopeless treadmill. No wonder security teams are getting burned out.</p>\n<h2><strong>Chilling Exploits</strong></h2>\n<p>Zero-days are especially concerning because many state actors have inventories of them that are ready to be used as weapons [4]. We tend to think of exploits as data exfiltrations or ransomware attacks. However, these are not the whole story. In 2007 at Idaho National Laboratory it was decided to test if malware could damage a full-size electricity generator [5]. The malware controlled a relay that connected or disconnected the generator from the power grid. By exercising a sequence of connects and disconnects, the malware was able to cause the generator to destroy itself. </p>\n<p>The result was not repairable damage, but rather scrap metal that could only be melted down to manufacture a new generator. The generator was destroyed in under a minute. Thus malware running on a tiny MCU was able to destroy a large machine. What if a bad actor could destroy 10% of the electricity generators in the U.S.? How long would it take to manufacture and install replacement generators? What would happen in the meantime?</p>\n<h2><strong>We Need a Better Solution</strong></h2>\n<p>We must recognize that patching and putting is not sufficient to deal with emerging new threats and the weaponized threats detailed above.</p>\n<p>Isolating vulnerable firmware is the better solution. This is amply demonstrated by Green Hills's Integrity for aerospace, BlackBerry's QNX for automotive, and several \"separation kernels\" by other companies. However, the problem with these solutions is that they require power-hungry processors, and isolation is at the process level using memory management units (MMUs). IoT devices generally require low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), their firmware is normally comprised of but a single process and they are limited to memory protection units (MPUs). What is needed is more granular isolation (i.e. at the task level) that works for MCUs. </p>\n<h2><strong>We Have Such a Solution</strong></h2>\n<p>We have demonstrated that isolated partitioning is practical for Cortex-M based MCUs (which comprise about 80% of all MCUs in production). In addition, the <em>pmode barrier</em> provided by this architecture provides additional protection for mission-critical and other trusted code. Such code needs only minimal modification for partitioning. The following figure illustrates the basics of Cortex-M partitioning and how it fits into the overall security picture:</p>\n\n<p>As shown, mission-critical firmware, security firmware, and handler mode (hmode) firmware are protected by the pmode barrier and run in privileged mode (pmode) or hmode. Vulnerable application firmware, SOUP, and middleware are above the pmode barrier and run in unprivileged mode (umode). Firmware in umode can access pmode or hmode only via exceptions caused by faults or via the SVC exception, which is used for system service calls. The pmode barrier is enforced by hardware and thus it is impenetrable from umode.</p>\n<p>As shown in the figure, umode firmware is divided into isolated partitions. If a hacker penetrates one umode partition, he cannot access data or code in other partitions. Communication between partitions is via portals, which preserve isolation. As a consequence a hacker may disable the functionality of one umode partition, but not others. In addition, pmode and umode code are doubly-protected by the pmode barrier. Thus the device is able to continue performing its primary functions and most secondary functions when attacked. During an attack, the breached partition can be stopped, the malware exorcised, and the partition rebooted to resume normal operation.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that isolated partitioning is as effective against zero-days as it is against unpatched vulnerabilities. It doesn't matter how the attacker got into the partition; he is sandboxed. In addition, partitioning enables siloing, which can mitigate insider threats (another growing attack vector), and provides hardware enforcement of certain good programming practices, which might lead to more on-time deliveries!</p>\n<p>For those interested, we have posted demos and an ebook at <a href=\"https://www.smxrtos.com/securesmx/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.smxrtos.com/securesmx</a>. May the good guys win!</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It also comes with self-deletion mechanisms to challenge detection.</p>\n<p>\"One of the hallmark features of ViperSoftX is its adept use of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) to orchestrate PowerShell operations within the AutoIt environment,\" the researchers said. \"This integration enables seamless execution of malicious functions while evading detection mechanisms that would typically flag standalone PowerShell activity.\"</p>\n<p>\"Furthermore, ViperSoftX's ability to patch the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) before executing PowerShell scripts underscores its determination to circumvent traditional security measures.\"</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

As many as 99,382 MikroTik routers are accessible over the internet.</p>\n<p>These routers, besides exposing an administration interface, run on outdated versions of the operating system, making them susceptible to known security vulnerabilities in RouterOS. It's suspected that threat actors are likely weaponizing the operating system's Bandwidth test feature to pull off the attacks.</p>\n\n<p>It's estimated that even hijacking 1% of the exposed devices into a DDoS botnet could theoretically give adversaries enough capabilities to launch <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/application-layer-ddos-attack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">layer 7 attacks</a> reaching 2.28 billion packets per second (Gpps).</p>\n<p>It bears noting at this stage that MikroTik routers have been <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/over-200000-microtik-routers-worldwide.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leveraged</a> for building potent botnets such as M\u0113ris and even used for launching botnet-as-a-service operations.</p>\n<p>\"Depending on the number of compromised devices and their actual capabilities, this could be a new era for packet rate attacks: with botnets possibly capable of issuing billions of packets per second, it could seriously challenge how anti-DDoS infrastructures are built and scaled,\" Meriot said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Since then, the malware has been ported to work on Android and macOS operating systems, turning it into a multi-platform tool.</p>\n<p>Subsequent findings from <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/meta-uncovers-massive-social-media.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/warning-gravityrat-android-trojan.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ESET</a> last year uncovered continued use of the Android version of GravityRAT to target military personnel in India and among the Pakistan Air Force by masquerading it as cloud storage, entertainment, and chat apps.</p>\n\n<p>Cisco Talos' findings bring all these disparate-but-related activities under a common umbrella, driven by evidence that points to the threat actor's use of GravityAdmin to orchestrate these attacks.</p>\n<p>Cosmic Leopard has been predominantly observed employing spear-phishing and social engineering to establish trust with prospective targets, before sending them a link to a malicious site that instructs them to download a seemingly innocuous program that drops GravityRAT or HeavyLift depending on the operating system used.</p>\n<p>GravityRAT is said to have been put to use as early as 2016. GravityAdmin, on the other hand, is a binary used to commandeer infected systems since at least August 2021 by establishing connections with GravityRAT and HeavyLift's command-and-control (C2) servers.</p>\n\n<p>\"GravityAdmin consists of multiple inbuilt User Interfaces (UIs) that correspond to specific, codenamed, campaigns being operated by malicious operators,\" the researchers noted. \"For example, 'FOXTROT,' 'CLOUDINFINITY,' and '<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/warning-gravityrat-android-trojan.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CHATICO</a>' are names given to all Android-based GravityRAT infections whereas 'CRAFTWITHME,' 'SEXYBER,' and 'CVSCOUT' are names for attacks deploying HeavyLift.\"</p>\n<p>The newly discovered component of the threat actor's arsenal is HeavyLift, an Electron-based malware loader family distributed via malicious installers targeting the Windows operating system. It also has similarities with GravityRAT's Electron versions documented previously by Kaspersky in 2020. </p>\n<p>The malware, once launched, is capable of gathering and exporting system metadata to a hard-coded C2 server, following it periodically polls the server for any new payloads to be executed on the system. What's more, it's designed to perform similar functions on macOS as well.</p>\n<p>\"This multi-year operation continuously targeted Indian entities and individuals likely belonging to defense, government, and related technology spaces,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It specifically affected three router models issued by the ISP: ActionTec T3200, ActionTec T3260, and Sagemcom.</p>\n<p>\"The incident took place over a 72-hour period between October 25-27, rendered the infected devices permanently inoperable, and required a hardware-based replacement,\" the company <a href=\"https://blog.lumen.com/the-pumpkin-eclipse/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a technical report.</p>\n\n<p>The blackout is significant, not least because it led to the abrupt removal of 49% of all modems from the impacted ISP's autonomous system number (ASN) during the time-frame.</p>\n<p>While the name of the ISP was not disclosed, evidence points to it being Windstream, which suffered an outage around the same time, causing <a href=\"https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r33771145-Equipment-T3200-issues\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">users</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Windstream/comments/17g9qdu/solid_red_light_on_t3200_modem/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> a \"steady red light\" being displayed by the impacted modems.</p>\n<p>Now, months later, Lumen's analysis has revealed a commodity remote access trojan (RAT) called <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2018/10/22/chalubo-botnet-wants-to-ddos-from-your-server-or-iot-device/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chalubo</a> \u2013 a stealthy malware first documented by Sophos in October 2018 \u2013 as responsible for the sabotage, with the adversary opting for it presumably in an effort to complicate attribution efforts rather than use a custom toolkit.</p>\n<p>\"Chalubo has payloads designed for all major SOHO/IoT kernels, pre-built functionality to perform DDoS attacks, and can execute any Lua script sent to the bot,\" the company said. \"We suspect the Lua functionality was likely employed by the malicious actor to retrieve the destructive payload.\"</p>\n<p>That said, the exact initial access method used to breach the routers is currently unclear, although it's theorized that it may have involved the abuse of weak credentials or exploited an exposed administrative interface.</p>\n<p>Upon gaining a successful foothold, the infection chain proceeds to drop shell scripts that pave the way for a loader ultimately designed to retrieve and launch Chalubo from an external server. The destructive Lua script module fetched by the trojan is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>A notable aspect of the campaign is its targeting of a single ASN, as opposed to others that have typically targeted a specific router model or common vulnerability, raising the possibility that it was deliberately targeted, although the motivations behind it are undetermined as yet.</p>\n<p>\"The event was unprecedented due to the number of units affected \u2013 no attack that we can recall has required the replacement of over 600,000 devices,\" Lumen said. \"In addition, this type of attack has only ever happened once before, with <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/suspected-russian-data-wiping-acidpour.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AcidRain</a> used as a precursor to an active military invasion.\"</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

2023.</p>\n<p>\"These repeated attacks against OT devices emphasize the crucial need to improve the security posture of OT devices and prevent critical systems from becoming easy targets,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team <a

target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>The company noted that a cyber attack on an OT system could allow malicious actors to tamper with critical parameters used in industrial processes, either programmatically via the programmable logic controller (PLC) or using the graphical controls of the human-machine interface (HMI), resulting in malfunctions and system outages.</p>\n<p>It further said that OT systems often lack adequate security mechanisms, making them ripe for exploitation by adversaries and carry out attacks that are \"relatively easy to execute,\" a fact compounded by the additional risks introduced by directly connecting OT devices to the internet.</p>\n<p>This not only makes the devices discoverable by attackers through internet scanning tools, but also be weaponized to gain initial access by taking advantage of weak sign-in passwords or outdated software with known vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Just last week, Rockwell Automation <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/rockwell-advises-disconnecting-internet.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> an advisory urging its customers to disconnect all industrial control systems (ICSs) not meant to be connected to the public-facing internet due to \"heightened geopolitical tensions and adversarial cyber activity globally.\"</p>\n<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/defending-ot-operations-against-ongoing-pro-russia-hacktivist-activity\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> a bulletin of its own warning of pro-Russia hacktivists targeting vulnerable industrial control systems in North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>\"Specifically, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,\" the agency said. \"In each case, the hacktivists maxed out set points, altered other settings, turned off alarm mechanisms, and changed administrative passwords to lock out the WWS operators.\"</p>\n<p>Microsoft further said the onset of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 led to a spike in cyber attacks against internet-exposed, poorly secured OT assets developed by Israeli companies, with many of them conducted by groups like <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/us-epa-forms-task-force-to-protect.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Av3ngers</a>, Soldiers of Solomon, and Abnaa Al-Saada that are affiliated with Iran.</p>\n<p>The attacks, per Redmond, singled out OT equipment deployed across different sectors in Israel that were manufactured by international vendors as well as those that were sourced from Israel but deployed in other countries.</p>\n<p>These OT devices are \"primarily internet-exposed OT systems with poor security posture, potentially accompanied by weak passwords and known vulnerabilities,\" the tech giant added.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risks posed by such threats, it's recommended that organizations ensure security hygiene for their OT systems, specifically by reducing the attack surface and implementing zero trust practices to prevent attackers from moving laterally within a compromised network.</p>\n<p>The development comes as OT security firm Claroty <a href=\"https://claroty.com/team82/research/unpacking-the-blackjack-groups-fuxnet-malware\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unpacked</a> a destructive malware strain called Fuxnet that the Blackjack hacking group, suspected to be backed by Ukraine, allegedly used against Moscollector, a Russian company that maintains a large network of sensors for monitoring Moscow's underground water and sewage systems for emergency detection and response.</p>\n<p>BlackJack, which <a href=\"https://ruexfil.com/mos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shared details</a> of the attack early last month, described Fuxnet as \"<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-new-bug-in-siemens-plcs-could-let.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stuxnet</a> on steroids,\" with Claroty noting that the malware was likely deployed remotely to the target sensor gateways using protocols such as SSH or the sensor protocol (SBK) over port 4321.</p>\n<p>Fuxnet comes with the capability to irrevocably destroy the filesystem, block access to the device, and physically destroy the NAND memory chips on the device by constantly writing and rewriting the memory in order to render it inoperable.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, it's designed to rewrite the UBI volume to prevent the sensor from rebooting, and ultimately corrupt the sensors themselves by sending a flood of bogus <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter-Bus\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meter-Bus</a> (M-Bus) messages.</p>\n<p>\"The attackers developed and deployed malware that targeted the gateways and deleted filesystems, directories, disabled remote access services, routing services for each device, and rewrote flash memory, destroyed NAND memory chips, UBI volumes and other actions that further disrupted operation of these gateways,\" Claroty noted.</p>\n<p>According to data shared by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky earlier this week, the internet, email clients, and removable storage devices emerged as the primary sources of threats to computers in an organization's OT infrastructure in the first quarter of 2024.</p>\n<p>\"Malicious actors use scripts for a wide range of objectives: collecting information, tracking, redirecting the browser to a malicious site, and uploading various types of malware (spyware and/or silent crypto mining tools) to the user's system or browser,\" it <a href=\"https://securelist.com/industrial-threat-landscape-q1-2024/112683/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"These spread via the internet and

The risk is widespread - 62% of the workforce is using unmanaged devices to access corporate data and 45% of all browsers within corporate devices use personal profiles.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser Extension Threats</strong> - 33% of all extensions within an organization pose a high risk, with 1% of installed extensions known to be malicious. The report highlights how deceptive extensions are used by attackers to hijack user data and lead users to phishing sites.</li>\n<li><strong>Shadow SaaS Risks</strong> - The clandestine use of Shadow SaaS applications by employees creates significant vulnerabilities, like blind spots and in identity management.</li>\n<li><strong>Identity Vulnerabilities</strong> - Shared accounts and Single Sign-On (SSO) practices lead to increased risks of unauthorized access. Incidents like the 23andMe data breach highlight the dangers of shared identities.</li>\n<li><strong>Gen-AI and LLM Vulnerabilities </strong>- 7.5% of employees risk data exposure by pasting or typing sensitive information into Generative AI tools like ChatGPT. There is a critical gap in the security community in understanding the risks associated with AI tools in corporate environments.</li>\n<li><strong>AI-Powered Threats</strong> - AI can be used to enhance attacks, from malware to phishing to browser extension exploitation to supply chain attacks. These threats leverage AI-driven personalization to make attacks more convincing and difficult to detect, or they use AI algorithms to improve attacking capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpatched Vulnerabilities</strong> - Unpatched vulnerabilities in browsers pose a significant risk. There are differences in patching times among browsers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Recommendations for Security Leaders</h2>\n<p>To combat these threats, the report's analysts recommend a multifaceted approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update browsers regularly and push security patches promptly to mitigate risks from outdated software.</li>\n<li>Restrict unauthorized extensions and regularly review permissions to prevent data theft.</li>\n<li>Train employees to identify and report suspicious emails and websites.</li>\n<li>Implement conditional access controls and promote clear BYOD policies to secure personal devices used for work.</li>\n<li>Enforce MFA and educate employees on password hygiene to enhance account security.</li>\n<li>Enforce secure configurations and the whitelisting of extensions.</li>\n<li>Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.</li>\n<li>Use advanced tools to detect and analyze browser data for threats, ensuring proactive threat mitigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Read the Report</h2>\n<p>The Annual Browser Security Report is an important resource for security leaders seeking to understand and mitigate browser-based risks. By adopting the recommended strategies, organizations can strengthen their defense against the increasingly sophisticated and threats targeting browsers.

The campaign is said to have come to an abrupt end four days later.</p>\n<p>The use of the Uptodown App Store app for the campaign indicates an attempt to pass off a legitimate third-party app marketplace and trick unsuspecting users into installing it. According to <a href=\"https://android-apk.org/com.uptodown/67444750-uptodown-com-uptodown/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stats</a> on Android-apk.org, the trojanized version of the app (5.92) has been downloaded 2,609 times to date.</p>\n\n<p>Wpeeper relies on a multi-tier C2 architecture that uses infected WordPress sites as an intermediary to obscure its true C2 servers. As many as 45 C2 servers have been identified as part of the infrastructure, nine of which are hard-coded into the samples and are used to update the C2 list on the fly. </p>\n<p>\"These [hard-coded servers] are not C2s but C2 redirectors -- their role is to forward the bot's requests to the real C2, aimed at shielding the actual C2 from detection,\" the researchers said.</p>\n\n<p>This has also raised the possibility that some of the hard-coded servers are directly under their control, since there is a risk of losing access to the botnet should WordPress site administrators get wind of the compromise and take steps to correct it.</p>\n<p>The commands retrieved from the C2 server allow the malware to collect device and file information, list of installed apps, update the C2 server, download and execute additional payloads from the C2 server or an arbitrary URL, and self-delete itself.</p>\n<p>The exact goals and scale of the campaign are presently unknown, although it's suspected that the sneaky method may have been used to increase the installation numbers and then reveal the malware's capabilities.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risks posed by such malware, it's always advised to install apps only from trusted sources, and scrutinize app reviews and permissions prior to downloading them.</p>\n<h3>Update</h3>\n<p>A Google spokesperson shared the below statement following the publication of the story -</p>\n<p><em>Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by </em><a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en\"><em>Google Play Protect</em></a><em>, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.

The backdoor then parses the log file and\n  searches for the line matching the same regular expression\n  (\"img\\[([a-zA-Z0-9+/=]+)\\]\") to decode and run the command within it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"The script will then create another thread that runs a function called\n  restore,\" Unit 42 said. \"The restore function takes the original content of\n  the bootstrap.min.css file, as well as the original access and modified times,\n  sleeps for 15 seconds and writes the original contents back to the file and\n  sets the access and modified times to their originals.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The main goal appears to be to avoid leaving traces of the command outputs,\n  necessitating that the results are exfiltrated within 15 seconds before the\n  file is overwritten.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Volexity, in its own analysis, said it observed the threat actor remotely\n  exploiting the firewall to create a reverse shell, download additional\n  tooling, pivot into internal networks, and ultimately exfiltrate data. The\n  exact scale of the campaign is presently unclear. The adversary has been\n  assigned the moniker UTA0218 by the company.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  \"The tradecraft and speed employed by the attacker suggests a highly capable\n  threat actor with a clear playbook of what to access to further their\n  objectives,\" the American cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://www.volexity.com/blog/2024/04/12/zero-day-exploitation-of-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-globalprotect-cve-2024-3400/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"UTA0218's initial objectives were aimed at grabbing the domain backup DPAPI\n  keys and targeting active directory credentials by obtaining the NTDS.DIT\n  file. They further targeted user workstations to steal saved cookies and login\n  data, along with the users' DPAPI keys.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n  Organizations are recommended to look for signs of lateral movement internally\n  from their Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall device.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The development has also prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\n  Security Agency (CISA) to <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/04/12/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">add</a> the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">KEV</a>) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the patches by April 19 to\n  mitigate potential threats. Palo Alto Networks is expected to release fixes\n  for the flaw no later than April 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"Targeting edge devices remains a popular vector of attack for capable threat\n  actors who have the time and resources to invest into researching new\n  vulnerabilities,\" Volexity said.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \"It is highly likely UTA0218 is a state-backed threat actor based on the\n  resources required to develop and exploit a vulnerability of this nature, the\n  type of victims targeted by this actor, and the capabilities displayed to\n  install the Python backdoor and further access victim networks.\"\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>In January 2024, Microsoft discovered they'd been the <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">victim of a hack</a> orchestrated by Russian-state hackers Midnight Blizzard (sometimes known as Nobelium). The concerning detail about this case is how easy it was to breach the software giant. It wasn't a highly technical hack that exploited a zero-day vulnerability \u2013 the hackers used a simple password spray attack to take control of an old, inactive account. This serves as a stark reminder of the importance of password security and why organizations need to protect every user account. </p>\n<h2>Password spraying: A simple yet effective attack</h2>\n<p>The hackers gained entry by using a <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/blog/microsoft-hack-password-spraying/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">password spray attack in November 2023</a>, Password spraying is a relatively simple brute force technique that involves trying the same password against multiple accounts. By bombarding user accounts with known weak and compromised passwords, the attackers were able to gain access to a legacy non-production test account within the Microsoft system which provided them with an initial foothold in the environment. This account either had unusual privileges or the hackers escalated them.</p>\n<p>The attack lasted for as long as seven weeks, during which the hackers exfiltrated emails and attached documents. This data compromised a 'very small percentage' of corporate email accounts, including those belonging to senior leadership and employees in the Cybersecurity and Legal teams. Microsoft's Security team detected the hack on January 12th and took immediate action to disrupt the hackers' activities and deny them further access. </p>\n<p>However, the fact that the hackers were able to access such sensitive internal information highlights the potential damage that can be caused by compromising even seemingly insignificant accounts. All attackers need is an initial foothold within your organization. </p>\n<h2>The importance of protecting all accounts</h2>\n<p>While organizations often prioritize the protection of privileged accounts, the attack on Microsoft demonstrates that every user account is a potential entry point for attackers. Privilege escalation means that attackers can achieve their goals without necessarily needing a highly privileged admin account as an entry point. </p>\n<p>Protecting an inactive low-privileged account is just as crucial as safeguarding a high-privileged admin account for several reasons. First, attackers often target these overlooked accounts as potential entry points into a network. Inactive accounts are more likely to have weak or outdated passwords, making them easier targets for brute force attacks. Once compromised, attackers can use these accounts to move laterally within the network, escalating their privileges and accessing sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Second, inactive accounts are often neglected in terms of security measures, making them attractive targets for hackers. Organizations may overlook implementing strong password policies or multi-factor authentication for these accounts, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. From an attacker's perspective, even low-privileged accounts can provide valuable access to certain systems or data within an organization. </p>\n<h2>Defend against password spray attacks</h2>\n<p>The Microsoft hack serves as a wake-up call for organizations to prioritize the security of every user account. It highlights the critical need for robust password protection measures across all accounts, regardless of their perceived significance. By implementing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication, conducting regular Active Directory audits, and continuously scanning for compromised passwords, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of being caught out in the same way.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active Directory auditing:</strong> Conducting regular audits of Active Directory can provide visibility into unused and inactive accounts, as well as other password-related vulnerabilities. Audits provide a valuable snapshot of your Active Directory but should always be complemented by ongoing risk mitigation efforts. If you're lacking visibility into your organization's inactive and stale user accounts, consider running a read-only audit with our free auditing tool that gives an interactive exportable report: <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-auditor/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specops Password Auditor</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Robust password policies:</strong> Organizations should enforce strong password policies that block weak passwords, such as common terms or keyboard walks like 'qwerty' or '123456.' Implementing long, unique passwords or passphrases is a strong defense against brute-force attacks. Custom dictionaries that block terms related to the organization and industry should also be included.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> Enabling MFA adds an authentication roadblock for hackers to overcome. MFA serves as an important layer of defense, although it's worth remembering that <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/blog/ways-mfa-breached-passwords/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MFA isn't foolproof</a>. It needs to be combined with strong password security. </li>\n<li><strong>Compromised password scans:</strong> Even strong passwords can become compromised if end users <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/blog/password-reuse-hidden-danger/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reuse them on personal devices</a>, sites, or applications with weak security. Implementing tools to continuously scan your Active Directory for compromised passwords can help identify and mitigate potential risks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Continuously shut down attack routes for hackers </h2>\n<p>The Microsoft hack underscores the need for organizations to implement robust password protection measures across all accounts. A secure password policy is essential, ensuring that all accounts, including legacy, non-production, and testing accounts, aren't overlooked. Additionally, blocking known compromised credentials adds an extra layer of protection against active attacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-policy/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specops Password Policy</a> with Breached Password Protection offers automated, ongoing protection for your Active Directory.

The emails bear themes related to invoices or financial and tax documents, in some cases purporting to be from local government tax agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Embedded within these messages are links to a website hosted on run[.]app, resulting in the delivery of a ZIP archive containing a malicious MSI file either directly or via 302 redirects to a Google Cloud Storage location, where the installer is stored.</p>\n<p>The threat actors have also been observed attempting to evade detection using geofencing tricks by redirecting visitors to these URLs to a legitimate site like Google when accessing them with a U.S. IP address.</p>\n<p>Besides leveraging the same infrastructure to deliver both Mekotio and Astaroth, the infection chain associated with the latter acts as a conduit to distribute Ousaban.</p>\n<p>Astaroth, Mekotio, and Ousaban are all designed to single out financial institutions, keeping tabs on users' web browsing activity as well as logging keystrokes and taking screenshots should one of the target bank websites be open.</p>\n<p>Ousaban has a history of <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/ousaban-latam-banking-malware-abusing-cloud-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weaponizing cloud services</a> to its advantage, having previously employed Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure to download second-stage payloads, and Google Docs to retrieve command-and-control (C2) configuration.</p>\n<p>The development comes amid phishing campaigns propagating <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-sound-alarm-on-dcrat-backdoor.html\"

<a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/technical-analysis-of-darkvnc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DarkVNC</a> that are capable of harvesting sensitive data and taking control of compromised hosts.</p>\n<p>It also follows an uptick in threat actors deploying QR codes in phishing and email-based attacks (aka quishing) to trick potential victims into installing malware on their mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>\"In a separate attack, the adversaries sent targets spear-phishing emails with malicious QR codes pointing to fake Microsoft Office 365 login pages that eventually steal the user's login credentials when entered,\" Talos <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/how-are-attackers-using-qr-codes-in-phishing-emails-and-lure-documents/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>\"QR code attacks are particularly dangerous because they move the attack vector off a protected computer and onto the target's personal mobile device, which usually has fewer security protections in place and ultimately has the sensitive information that attackers are after.\"</p>\n<p>Phishing campaigns have also set their eyes on the oil and gas sector to deploy an information stealer called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/rhadamanthys-malware-swiss-army-knife.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rhadamanthys</a>, which has currently reached version 0.6.0, highlighting a <a href=\"https://cyberint.com/blog/research/blink-and-update-all-about-rhadamanthys-stealer/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">steady stream of patches and updates</a> by its developers.</p>\n<p>\"The campaign starts with a phishing email using a vehicle incident report to lure victims into interacting with an embedded link that abuses an

rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Users who click on the link are then redirected to a website hosting a bogus PDF file, which, in reality, is a clickable image that contacts a GitHub repository and downloads a ZIP archive containing the stealer executable.</p>\n<p>\"Once a victim attempts to interact with the executable, the malware will unpack and start a connection with a command-and-control (C2) location that collects any stolen credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, or other sensitive information,\" the company added.</p>\n<p>Other campaigns have abused email marketing tools like Twilio's SendGrid to obtain client mailing lists and take advantage of stolen credentials to send out convincing-looking phishing emails, per Kaspersky.</p>\n<p>\"What makes this campaign particularly insidious is that the phishing emails bypass traditional security measures,\" the Russian cybersecurity company <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/sendgrid-credentials-phishing/50662/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a>. \"Since they are sent through a legitimate service and contain no obvious signs of phishing, they may evade detection by automatic filters.\"</p>\n<p>These phishing activities are further fueled by the <a

The botnet is known to comprise two main sub-groups, viz. KV and JDY, with the latter principally used for scanning potential targets for reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>Late last month, the U.S. government <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/us-feds-shut-down-china-linked-kv.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a court-authorized disruption effort to take down the KV cluster, which is typically reserved for manual operations against high-profile targets chosen after broader scanning via the JDY sub-group.</p>\n\n<p>Now, according to new findings from the cybersecurity firm, the JDY cluster fell silent for roughly fifteen days following public disclosure and as a byproduct of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) undertaking.</p>\n<p>\"In mid-December 2023, we observed this activity cluster hovering around 1,500 active bots,\" security researcher Ryan English said. \"When we sampled the size of this cluster in mid-January 2024 its size dwindled to approximately 650 bots.\"</p>\n<p>Given that the takedown actions began with a signed warrant issued on December 6, 2023, it's fair to assume that the FBI began transmitting commands to routers located in the U.S. sometime on or after that date to wipe the botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected.</p>\n<p>\"We observed the KV-botnet operators begin to restructure, committing eight straight hours of activity on December 8, 2023, nearly ten hours of operations the following day on December 9, 2023, followed by one hour on December 11, 2023,\" Lumen <a href=\"https://blog.lumen.com/kv-botnet-dont-call-it-a-comeback/\">said</a> in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.</p>\n\n<p>During this four-day period, the threat actor was spotted interacting with 3,045 unique IP addresses that were associated with NETGEAR ProSAFEs (2,158), Cisco RV320/325 (310), Axis IP cameras (29), DrayTek Vigor routers (17), and other unidentified devices (531).</p>\n<p>Also observed in early December 2023 was a massive spike in exploitation attempts from the payload server, indicating the adversary's likely attempts to re-exploit the devices as they detected their infrastructure going offline. Lumen said it also took steps to null-route another set of backup servers that became operational around the same time.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that the operators of the KV-botnet are known to perform their own reconnaissance and targeting while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon. Interestingly, the timestamps associated with exploitation of the bots correlates to China working hours.</p>\n<p>\"Our telemetry indicates that there were administrative connections into the known payload servers from IP addresses associated with China Telecom,\" Danny Adamitis, principal information security engineer at Black Lotus Labs, told The Hacker News.</p>\n\n<p>What's more, the press statement from the U.S. Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> the botnet as controlled by \"People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hackers.\"</p>\n<p>This raises the possibility that the botnet \"was created by an organization supporting the Volt Typhoon hackers; whereas if the botnet was created by Volt Typhoon, we suspect they would have said 'nation-state' actors,\" Adamitis added.</p>\n<p>There are also signs that the threat actors established a third related-but-distinct botnet cluster dubbed x.sh as early as January 2023 that's composed of infected Cisco routers by deploying a web shell named \"fys.sh,\" as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/china-backed-hackers-hijack-software.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highlighted</a> by SecurityScorecard last month.</p>\n\n<p>But with KV-botnet being just \"one form of infrastructure used by Volt Typhoon to obfuscate their activity,\" it's expected that the recent wave of actions will prompt the advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to presumably transition to another covert network in order to meet their strategic goals.</p>\n<p>\"A significant percent of all networking equipment in use around the world is functioning perfectly well, but is no longer supported,\" English said. \"End users have a difficult financial choice when a device reaches that point, and many aren't even aware that a router or firewall is at the end of its supported life.</p>\n<p>\"Advanced threat actors are well aware that this represents fertile ground for exploitation. Replacing unsupported devices is always the best choice, but not always feasible.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mitigation involves defenders adding their edge devices to the long list of those they already have to patch and update as often as available, rebooting devices and configuring EDR or SASE solutions where applicable, and keeping an eye on large data transfers out of the network. Geofencing is not a defense to rely on, when the threat actor can hop from a nearby point.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The law enforcement effort was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-disabled-chinese-hacking-network-targeting-critical-infrastructure-sources-2024-01-29/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> by Reuters earlier this week.</p>\n<p>\"The vast majority of routers that comprised the KV-botnet were Cisco and NetGear routers that were vulnerable because they had reached 'end of life' status; that is, they were no longer supported through their manufacturer's security patches or other software updates,\" the Department of Justice (DoJ) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a press statement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/chinese-hackers-using-never-before-seen.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Volt Typhoon</a> (aka DEV-0391, Bronze Silhouette, Insidious Taurus, or Vanguard Panda) is the moniker assigned to a China-based adversarial collective that has been attributed to cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S. and Guam.</p>\n<p>\"Chinese cyber actors, including a group known as 'Volt Typhoon,' are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyber attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States,\" CISA Director Jen Easterly <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/opening-statement-cisa-director-jen-easterly\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a>.</p>\n<p>The cyber espionage group, believed to be active since 2021, is known for its reliance on legitimate tools and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to fly under the radar and persist within victim environments for extended periods of time to gather sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p>Another important aspect of its modus operandi is that it tries to blend into normal network activity by routing traffic through compromised SOHO network equipment, including routers, firewalls, and VPN hardware, in an attempt to obfuscate their origins.</p>\n<p>This is accomplished by means of the KV-botnet, which commandeers devices from Cisco, DrayTek, Fortinet, and NETGEAR for use as a covert data transfer network for advanced persistent threat actors. It's suspected that the botnet operators offer their services to other hacking outfits, including Volt Typhoon.</p>\n<p>In January 2024, a report from cybersecurity firm SecurityScorecard <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/china-backed-hackers-hijack-software.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> how the botnet has been responsible for compromising as much as 30% \u2014 or 325 of 1,116 \u2014 of end-of-life Cisco RV320/325 routers over a 37-day period from December 1, 2023, to January 7, 2024.</p>\n<p>\"Volt Typhoon is at least one user of the KV-botnet and [...] this botnet encompasses a subset of their operational infrastructure,\" Lumen Black Lotus Labs said, adding the botnet \"has been active since at least February 2022.\"</p>\n<p>The company told The Hacker News that KV-botnet was operated separately, with the threat actors behind it performing their own reconnaissance and targeting, while also supporting multiple groups like Volt Typhoon.</p>\n<p>The botnet is also designed to download a virtual private network (VPN) module to the vulnerable routers and set up a direct encrypted communication channel to control the botnet and use it as an intermediary relay node to achieve their operational goals.</p>\n<p>\"One function of the KV-botnet is to transmit encrypted traffic between the infected SOHO routers, allowing the hackers to anonymize their activities (i.e., the hackers appear to be operating from the SOHO routers, versus their actual computers in China),\" according to affidavits filed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>\n<p>As part of its efforts to disrupt the botnet, the agency said it remotely issued commands to target routers in the U.S. using the malware's communication protocols to delete the KV-botnet payload and prevent them from being re-infected. The FBI said it also notified every victim about the operation, either directly or via their internet service provider if contact information was not available.</p>\n<p>\"The court-authorized operation deleted the KV-botnet malware from the routers and took additional steps to sever their connection to the botnet, such as blocking communications with other devices used to control the botnet,\" the DoJ added.</p>\n<p>It's important to point out here that the unspecified prevention measures employed to remove the routers from the botnet are temporary and cannot survive a reboot. In other words, simply restarting the devices would render them susceptible to re-infection.</p>\n<p>\"The Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide, among other things, pre-operational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors \u2013 steps China was taking, in other words, to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/china-s-hackers-have-entire-nation-in-their-crosshairs-fbi-director-warns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Chinese government, in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-disrupts-chinese-botnet-targeting-critical-infrastructure-fbi-says-2024-01-31/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> shared with Reuters, denied any involvement in the attacks, dismissing it as a \"disinformation campaign\" and that it \"has been categorical in opposing hacking attacks and the abuse of information technology.\"</p>\n<p>Coinciding with the takedown, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published new guidance urging SOHO device manufacturers to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">secure by design approach</a> during development and shift the burden away from customers.</p>\n<p>Specifically, it's recommending that manufacturers eliminate exploitable defects in SOHO router web management interfaces and modify default device configurations to support automatic update capabilities and require a manual override to remove security settings.</p>\n<p>The compromise of edge devices such as routers for use in advanced persistent attacks mounted by <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/us-and-uk-warn-of-russian-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/chinas-blacktech-hacking-group.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">China</a> highlights a growing problem that's compounded by the fact that legacy devices no longer receive security patches and do not support endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</p>\n<p>\"The creation of products that lack appropriate security controls is unacceptable given the current threat environment,\" CISA <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/01/31/cisa-and-fbi-release-secure-design-alert-urging-manufacturers-eliminate-defects-soho-routers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"This case exemplifies how a lack of secure by design practices can lead to real-world harm both to customers and, in this case, our nation's critical infrastructure.\"</p>\n<p><em>(The story was updated after publication to include additional comments from Lumen Black Lotus Labs.)</em></p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It can also display fake pop-up windows and block the victim's screen.</p>\n<p>Attack chains typically leverage phishing lures bearing decoy documents or malicious URLs that, when opened or clicked, lead to the deployment of malware, which then establishes contact with a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server for remotely controlling the machine in a manual fashion.</p>\n<p>\"Grandoreiro periodically monitors the foreground window to find one that belongs to a web browser process,\" ESET <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-takes-part-global-operation-disrupt-grandoreiro-banking-trojan/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"When such a window is found and its name matches any string from a hardcoded list of bank-related strings, then and only then the malware initiates communication with its C&amp;C server, sending requests at least once a second until terminated.\"</p>\n<p>The threat actors behind the malware are also known to employ a domain generation algorithm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_generation_algorithm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DGA</a>) since around October 2020 to dynamically identify a destination domain for C&amp;C traffic, making it harder to block, track, or take over the infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A majority of the IP addresses these domains resolve to are provided primarily by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, with the life span of the C&amp;C IP addresses ranging anywhere between 1 day to 425 days. On average, there are 13 active and three new C&amp;C IP addresses per day, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>ESET also said that Grandoreiro's flawed implementation of its RealThinClient (RTC) network protocol for C&amp;C made it possible to get information about the number of victims that are connected to the C&amp;C server, determining 551 unique victims in a day on average that are mainly spread across Brazil, Mexico, and Spain.</p>\n<p>Further investigation has found that an average number of 114 new unique victims connect to the C&amp;C servers each day.</p>\n<p>\"The disruption operation led by the Federal Police of Brazil aimed at individuals who are believed to be high up in the Grandoreiro operation hierarchy,\" ESET said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It's also known to identify and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/microsoft-warns-of-hackers-exploiting.html\" target=\"_blank\">abuse OAuth applications</a> to move laterally across cloud infrastructures and for post-compromise activity, such as email collection.</p>\n<p>\"They utilize diverse initial access methods ranging from stolen credentials to supply chain attacks, exploitation of on-premises environments to laterally move to the cloud, and exploitation of service providers' trust chain to gain access to downstream customers,\" Microsoft noted.</p>\n<p>Another notable tactic entails the use of breached user accounts to create, modify, and grant high permissions to OAuth applications that they can misuse to hide malicious activity. This enables threat actors to maintain access to applications, even if they lose access to the initially compromised account, the company pointed out.</p>\n<p>These malicious OAuth applications are ultimately used to authenticate to Microsoft Exchange Online and target Microsoft corporate email accounts to exfiltrate data of interest.</p>\n<p>In the incident targeting Microsoft in November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack to successfully infiltrate a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.</p>\n\n<p>\"In this observed Midnight Blizzard activity, the actor tailored their password spray attacks to a limited number of accounts, using a low number of attempts to evade detection and avoid account blocks based on the volume of failures,\" it said.</p>\n<p>The intruders then leveraged their initial access to identify and compromise a legacy test OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment, weaponizing it to create additional malicious OAuth applications and grant them the Office 365 Exchange Online <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-limit-mailbox-access\">full_access_as_app role</a> in order to obtain access to mailboxes.</p>\n<p>Such attacks are launched from a distributed residential proxy infrastructure to conceal their origins, allowing the threat actor to interact with the compromised tenant and with Exchange Online via a vast network of IP addresses that are also used by legitimate users.</p>\n<p>\"Midnight Blizzard's use of residential proxies to obfuscate connections makes traditional indicators of compromise (IoC)-based detection infeasible due to the high changeover rate of IP addresses,\" Redmond said, necessitating that organizations take steps to defend against rogue OAuth applications and password spraying.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>The cyber attacks targeting the energy sector in Denmark last year may not have had the involvement of the Russia-linked Sandworm hacking group, <a href=\"https://www.forescout.com/blog/analysis-of-energy-sector-cyberattacks-in-denmark-and-ukraine/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new findings</a> from Forescout show.</p>\n<p>The intrusions, which <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/russian-hackers-launch-largest-ever.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">targeted around 22 Danish energy organizations</a> in May 2023, occurred in two distinct waves, one which exploited a security flaw in Zyxel firewall (CVE-2023-28771) and a follow-on activity cluster that saw the attackers deploy Mirai botnet variants on infected hosts via an as-yet-unknown initial access vector.</p>\n\n<p>The first wave took place on May 11, while the second wave lasted from May 22 to 31, 2023. In one such attack detected on May 24, it was observed that the compromised system was communicating with IP addresses (217.57.80[.]18 and 70.62.153[.]174) that were previously used as command-and-control (C2) for the now-dismantled <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/fbi-shut-down-russia-linked-cyclops.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclops Blink</a> botnet.</p>\n\n<p>Forescout's closer examination of the attack campaign, however, has revealed that not only were the two waves unrelated, but also unlikely the work of the state-sponsored group owing to the fact the second wave was part of a broader mass exploitation campaign against unpatched Zyxel firewalls. It's currently not known who is behind the twin sets of attacks.</p>\n<p>\"The campaign described as the 'second wave' of attacks on Denmark, started before and continued after [the 10-day time period], targeting firewalls indiscriminately in a very similar manner, only changing staging servers periodically,\" the company said in a report aptly titled \"Clearing the Fog of War.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is evidence to suggest that the attacks may have started as early as February 16 using other known flaws Zyxel devices (CVE-2020-9054 and CVE-2022-30525) alongside CVE-2023-28771, and persisted as late as October 2023, with the activity singling out various entities across Europe and the U.S.</p>\n<p>\"This is further evidence that exploitation of CVE-2023-27881, rather than being limited to Danish critical infrastructure, is ongoing and targeting exposed devices, some of which just happen to be Zyxel firewalls safeguarding critical infrastructure organizations,\" Forescout added.</p>\n<p>When reached for comment, SektorCERT pointed to its November 2023 report, in which it noted that \"whether Sandworm was involved in the attack cannot be said with certainty. Individual indicators of this have been observed, but we have no opportunity to neither confirm nor deny it.\"</p>\n<p>The non-profit also reiterated that cyber attacks are difficult to attribute to a specific threat actor and that it doesn't have any concrete evidence to accuse Russia of being involved in the attack.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

However, there is evidence to suggest that it may have been employed as early as 2020.</p>\n\n<p>While the full extent of MuddyC2Go's capabilities is not yet known, the executable comes fitted with a PowerShell script that automatically connects to Seedworm's C2 server, thereby giving the attackers remote access to a victim system and obviating the need for manual execution by an operator.</p>\n<p>The latest set of intrusions, which took place in November 2023, have also been found to rely on SimpleHelp and Venom Proxy, alongside a custom keylogger and other publicly available tools.</p>\n<p>Attack chains mounted by the group have a track record of weaponizing phishing emails and <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/iranian-hackers-exploiting-unpatched.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">known vulnerabilities</a> in unpatched applications for initial access, followed by conducting reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data collection.</p>\n<p>In the attacks documented by Symantec targeting an unnamed telecommunications organization, the MuddyC2Go launcher was executed to establish contact with an actor-controlled server, while also deploying legitimate remote access software like AnyDesk and SimpleHelp.</p>\n<p>The entity is said to have been previously compromised by the adversary earlier in 2023 in which SimpleHelp was used to launch PowerShell, deliver proxy software, and also install the JumpCloud remote access tool.</p>\n<p>\"In another telecommunications and media company targeted by the attackers, multiple incidents of SimpleHelp were used to connect to known Seedworm infrastructure,\" Symantec noted. \"A custom build of the <a

by the attackers in this activity.\"</p>\n<p>By utilizing a combination of bespoke, living-off-the-land, and publicly available tools in its attack chains, the goal is to evade detection for as long as possible to meet its strategic objectives, the company said.</p>\n<p>\"The group continues to innovate and develop its toolset when required in order to keep its activity under the radar,\"

        "contents": "\n<p>2023 has seen its fair share of cyber attacks, however there's one attack vector that proves to be more prominent than others - non-human access. With <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/11-attacks-in-13-months-the-new-generation-of-supply-chain-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">11 high-profile attacks in 13 months </a>and an ever-growing ungoverned attack surface, non-human identities are the new perimeter, and 2023 is only the beginning. </p>\n<h2>Why non-human access is a cybercriminal's paradise </h2>\n<p>People always look for the easiest way to get what they want, and this goes for cybercrime as well. Threat actors look for the path of least resistance, and it seems that in 2023 this path was non-user access credentials (API keys, tokens, service accounts and secrets). </p>\n<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>\"</em><strong><em>50% of the active access tokens connecting Salesforce and third-party apps are unused. In GitHub and GCP the numbers reach 33%.\"</em></strong></blockquote><strong><em></em></strong><p></p>\n<p>These non-user access credentials are used to connect apps and resources to other cloud services. What makes them a true hacker's dream is that they have no security measures like user credentials do (MFA, SSO or other IAM policies), they are mostly over-permissive, ungoverned, and never-revoked. In fact, 50% of the active access tokens connecting Salesforce and third-party apps are unused. In GitHub and GCP the numbers reach 33%.* </p>\n<p>So how do cybercriminals exploit these non-human access credentials? To understand the attack paths, we need to first understand the types of non-human access and identities. Generally, there are two types of non-human access - external and internal. </p>\n\n<p>External non-human access is created by employees connecting third-party tools and services to core business &amp; engineering environments like Salesforce, Microsoft365, Slack, GitHub and AWS - to streamline processes and increase agility. These connections are done through API keys, service accounts, OAuth tokens and webhooks, that are owned by the third-party app or service (the non-human identity). With the growing trend of bottom-up software adoption and freemium cloud services, many of these connections are regularly made by different employees without any security governance and, even worse, from unvetted sources. Astrix research shows that 90% of the apps connected to Google Workspace environments are non-marketplace apps - meaning they were not vetted by an official app store. In Slack, the numbers reach 77%, while in Github they reach 50%.* </p>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong></p><blockquote><strong><em>\"74% of Personal Access Tokens in GitHub environments have no expiration.\"</em></strong></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>Internal non-human access is similar, however, it is created with <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/not-just-code-vulnerabilities-the-overlooked-cause-of-software-supply-chain-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">internal access credentials</a> - also known as 'secrets'. R&amp;D teams regularly generate secrets that connect different resources and services. These secrets are often scattered across multiple secret managers (vaults), without any visibility for the security team of where they are, if they're exposed, what they allow access to, and if they are misconfigured. In fact, 74% of Personal Access Tokens in GitHub environments have no expiration. Similarly, 59% of the webhooks in GitHub are misconfigured - meaning they are unencrypted and unassigned.* </p>\n<p><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/schedule-a-live-demo/?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_article&amp;utm_campaign=hackernewsarticle\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Schedule a live demo of Astrix - a leader in non-human identity security </a></p>\n<h2>2023's high-profile attacks exploiting non-human access</h2>\n<p>This threat is anything but theoretical. 2023 has seen some big brands falling victim to non-human access exploits, with thousands of customers affected. In such attacks, attackers take advantage of exposed or stolen access credentials to penetrate organizations' most sensitive core systems, and in the case of external access - reach their customers' environments (supply chain attacks). Some of these high-profile attacks include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/okta-breach-leaked-service-account/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Okta </a>(October 2023): Attackers used a leaked service account to access Okta's support case management system. This allowed the attackers to view files uploaded by a number of Okta customers as part of recent support cases.</li>\n<li><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://checkmarx.com/blog/surprise-when-dependabot-contributes-malicious-code/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Dependabot</a> (September 2023): Hackers stole GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT). These tokens were then used to make unauthorized commits as Dependabot to both public and private GitHub repositories.</li>\n<li><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.wiz.io/blog/38-terabytes-of-private-data-accidentally-exposed-by-microsoft-ai-researchers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft SAS Key </a>(September 2023): A SAS token that was published by Microsoft's AI researchers actually granted full access to the entire Storage account it was created on, leading to a leak of over 38TB of extremely sensitive information. These permissions were available for attackers over the course of more than 2 years (!).</li>\n<li><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/slacks-github-breach-6-tips-to-avoid-similar-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Slack GitHub Repositories</a> (January 2023): Threat actors gained access to Slack's externally hosted GitHub repositories via a \"limited\" number of stolen Slack employee tokens. From there, they were able to download private code repositories.</li>\n<li><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/the-circleci-breach-the-results-of-a-stolen-access-token/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CircleCI</a> (January 2023): An engineering employee's computer was compromised by malware that bypassed their antivirus solution. The compromised machine allowed the threat actors to access and steal session tokens. Stolen session tokens give threat actors the same access as the account owner, even when the accounts are protected with two-factor authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The impact of GenAI access</h2>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong></p><blockquote><strong><em>\"32% of GenAI apps connected to Google Workspace environments have very wide access permissions (read, write, delete).\"</em></strong></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>As one might expect, the vast adoption of GenAI tools and services exacerbates the non-human access issue. GenAI has gained enormous popularity in 2023, and it is likely to only grow. With <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-may-be-fastest-growing-app-in-history-ubs-study-2023-2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT becoming the fastest growing app in history</a>, and AI-powered apps being downloaded <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/user-spending-goes-up-by-more-than-4000-on-ai-powered-apps/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1506% more than last year</a>, the security risks of using and connecting often unvetted GenAI apps to business core systems is already causing sleepless nights for security leaders. The numbers from Astrix Research provide another testament to this attack surface: 32% of GenAI apps connected to Google Workspace environments have very wide access permissions (read, write, delete).* </p>\n<p>The risks of GenAI access are hitting waves industry wide. In a recent report named <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.gartner.com/document/4623399?ref=solrAll&amp;refval=379579725&amp;\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"Emerging Tech: Top 4 Security Risks of GenAI</a>\", Gartner explains the risks that come with the prevalent use of GenAI tools and technologies. According to the report, \"The use of generative AI (GenAI) large language models (LLMs) and chat interfaces, especially connected to third-party solutions outside the organization firewall, represent a widening of attack surfaces and security threats to enterprises.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Security has to be an enabler</h2>\n<p>Since non-human access is the direct result of cloud adoption and automation - both welcomed trends contributing to growth and efficiency, security must support it. With security leaders continuously striving to be enablers rather than blockers, an approach for securing non-human identities and their access credentials is no longer an option. </p>\n<p>Improperly secured non-human access, both external and internal, massively increases the likelihood of supply chain attacks, data breaches, and compliance violations. Security policies, as well as automatic tools to enforce them, are a must for those who look to secure this volatile attack surface while allowing the business to reap the benefits of automation and hyper-connectivity. </p>\n<p><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://astrix.security/schedule-a-live-demo/?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_article&amp;utm_campaign=hackernewsarticle\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Schedule a live demo of Astrix - a leader in non-human identity security </a></p>\n<p><i>*According to Astrix Research data, collected from enterprise environments of organizations with 1000-10,000 employees</i></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In this article, we show how threat actors can exploit ChatGPT, but also how defenders can use it for leveling up their game.</em></p>\n<p>ChatGPT is the most swiftly growing consumer application to date. The extremely popular generative AI chatbot has the ability to generate human-like, coherent and contextually relevant responses. This makes it very valuable for applications like content creation, coding, education, customer support, and even personal assistance.</p>\n<p>However, ChatGPT also comes with security risks. ChatGPT can be used for data exfiltration, spreading misinformation, developing cyber attacks and writing phishing emails. On the flip side, it can help defenders who can use it for identifying vulnerabilities and learning about various defenses.</p>\n<p>In this article, we show numerous ways attackers can exploit ChatGPT and the OpenAI Playground. Just as importantly, we show ways that defenders can leverage ChatGPT to enhance their security posture as well.</p>\n<h2>The Threat Actor - Hacking Made Easy</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT makes it easier for people looking to enter the world of cybercrime. Here are a few ways it can be used for system exploitation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finding Vulnerabilities </strong>- Attackers can prompt ChatGPT about potential vulnerabilities in websites, systems, APIs, and other network components.\n<p>According to Etay Maor, Senior Director of Security Strategy at <a href=\"https://www.catonetworks.com/?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Cato Networks</b></a>, \"There are guardrails in ChatGPT and the Playground to prevent them from giving answers that support doing something bad or evil. But, 'social engineering' the AI enables finding a way around that wall.\"</p>\n<p>For example, this can be done by impersonating a pen tester about how to test a website's input field for vulnerabilities. The response from ChatGPT will include a list of website exploitation methods, like input validation testing, XSS testing, SQL injection testing, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Exploiting Existing Vulnerabilities</strong> - ChatGPT can also provide attackers with the technological information they need about how to exploit an existing vulnerability. For example, a threat actor could ask ChatGPT how to test a known SQL injection vulnerability in a website field. ChatGPT will respond with input examples that will trigger the vulnerability.</li>\n<li><strong>Using Mimikatz</strong> - Threat actors can prompt ChatGPT to write code that downloads and runs Mimikatz.</li>\n<li><strong>Writing Phishing Emails</strong> - ChatGPT can be prompted to create authentic-looking phishing emails across a wide variety of languages and writing styles. In the example below, the prompt requests that the email is written to sound like it's coming from a CEO.</li>\n<li><strong>Identifying Confidential Files</strong> - ChatGPT can help attackers identify files with confidential data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the example below, ChatGPT is prompted to write a Python script that searches for Doc and PDF files that contain the word \"confidential,\" copy them into a random folder and transfer them. While the code is not perfect, it is a good start for a person who wants to develop this capability. Prompts could also be more sophisticated and include encryption, creating a Bitcoin wallet for the ransom money, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>The Defender - Defending Made Easy</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT can and should also be used to enhance defender capabilities. According to Etay Maor, \"ChatGPT also lowers the bar, in a good sense, for Defenders and for people who want to get into security.\" Here are a number of ways professionals can improve their security expertise and capabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learning New Terms and Technologies</strong> - ChatGPT can shorten the time it takes to research and learn new terms, technologies, processes and methodologies. It provides immediate, accurate and concise answers to security-related questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the example below, ChatGPT explains what a specific snort rule is.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summarizing Security Reports</strong> - ChatGPT can help summarize breach reports, helping analysts learn about how attacks were performed so they can prevent them from recurring in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Deciphering Attacker Code</strong> - Analysts can upload attacker code to ChatGPT and get an explanation of the steps taken and the executed payload.</li>\n<li><strong>Predicting Attack Paths</strong> - ChatGPT can predict future probable attack paths of an attack, by analyzing similar past cyber attacks and the techniques that were used.</li>\n<li><strong>Researching Threat Actors and Attack Paths</strong> - Providing a report that maps a threat actor, including their recent attacks, technical data, mapping to frameworks, and more. In this example, a detailed, technical report is provided about the ALPHV Ransomware group.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-0NBAzAVCc8UKw7J0Aesc-3w3fNn3QPtyiO5zO1frxa0ocAuM5N8GZ5-LCowyZQb-yBSOggA58gdBx2IMO10jURSYv-90bHT7lnDRCGxaM5BKTXyVJsAjxuaWKT76P7RF17NVNTDfcBqfzjRAhtsVu6AR24bkW0xcomDaVfRTXRrKByhyqAgk59ficGw/s728-rw-e365/chatgptmc_image3.png\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; float: left;  text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Offensive and Defensive AI\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"848\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-0NBAzAVCc8UKw7J0Aesc-3w3fNn3QPtyiO5zO1frxa0ocAuM5N8GZ5-LCowyZQb-yBSOggA58gdBx2IMO10jURSYv-90bHT7lnDRCGxaM5BKTXyVJsAjxuaWKT76P7RF17NVNTDfcBqfzjRAhtsVu6AR24bkW0xcomDaVfRTXRrKByhyqAgk59ficGw/s728-rw-e365/chatgptmc_image3.png\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" title=\"Offensive and Defensive AI\"/></a></div>\n<li><strong>Identifying Code Vulnerabilities </strong>- Engineers can paste code in ChatGPT and prompt it to identify any vulnerabilities. ChatGPT can even identify vulnerabilities when there is no bug, only a logical error. Be wary of the code you upload. If it contains proprietary data you may be exposing it externally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identifying Suspicious Activities in Logs</strong> - Reviewing log activity and looking for suspicious activities. </li>\n<li><strong>Identifying Vulnerable Web Pages </strong>- Web developers or security professionals can prompt ChatGPT to review a website's HTML code and identify vulnerabilities that would enable SQL injections, CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, or DDoS attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Additional Considerations When Using ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>When using ChatGPT, it's important to acknowledge the importance of the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Copyrights</strong> - Who owns the generated content? When asking ChatGPT, the answer is that the person who wrote the prompt owns them. However, it is not as simple as that. This issue is still not completely resolved and will depend on various legal systems and precedents. A body of law is currently emerging about this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Data retention - </strong>OpenAI may retain some of the data used as prompts for training or other research purposes. That's why it's important to exercise caution and avoid pasting any sensitive data into the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy - </strong>There are privacy issues surrounding ChatGPT, ranging from how it uses the data it is being prompted with to how it stores user interactions. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid entering PII or customer data into the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Bias - </strong>ChatGPT is subject to bias. For example, when asked to rate groups based on intelligence, it placed certain ethnicities before others. Using responses blindly could have significant consequences for individuals. For example, if it is used to guide decision-making in courts, police profiling, recruitment processes, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - It's important to verify ChatGPT's results, since they are not always accurate (i.e, 'hallucinations'. In the example below, ChatGPT was prompted to write a list of five-letter words starting with B and ending with KE. One of the answers was \"Bike\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AI vs. AI</strong> - Currently ChatGPT is not able to identify if a prompted text was written by AI or not. In the future, newer versions might be able to, which can help with security efforts. For example, this ability could help identify phishing emails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Etay summarizes, \"We can't stop progress, but we do need to teach people how to use these tools.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>To learn more about how security professionals can make the most of ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://catonetworks.easywebinar.live/registration-offensive-and-defensive-chatgpt?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">watch the entire masterclass here.</a></b></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Attack chains orchestrated by the threat actor have singled out telecom providers in the Middle East using a stealthy backdoor known as HTTPSnoop.</p>\n<p>The activity represented by Scarred Manticore is characterized by the use of a previously unknown passive malware framework referred to as LIONTAIL that's installed on Windows servers. The threat actor is believed to be active since at least 2019.</p>\n<p>\"Scarred Manticore has been pursuing high-value targets for years, utilizing a variety of IIS-based backdoors to attack Windows servers,\" Check Point researchers <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-albania-to-the-middle-east-the-scarred-manticore-is-listening/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a Tuesday analysis. \"These include a variety of custom web shells, custom DLL backdoors, and driver-based implants.\"</p>\n<p>An advanced piece of malware, LIONTAIL is a collection of custom shellcode loaders and memory resident shellcode payloads. A noteworthy component of the framework is a lightweight-yet-sophisticated implant written in C that enables attackers to execute commands remotely via HTTP requests.</p>\n<p>The attack sequences entail infiltrating publicly facing Windows servers to kick off the malware delivery process and systematically harvest sensitive data from infected hosts.</p>\n\n<p>\"Instead of using the HTTP API, the malware uses IOCTLs to interact directly with the underlying HTTP.sys driver,\" the researchers said, detailing the command-and-control (C2) mechanism.</p>\n<p>\"This approach is stealthier as it doesn't involve IIS or HTTP API, which are usually closely monitored by security solutions, but is not a straightforward task given that the IOCTLs for HTTP.sys are undocumented and require additional research efforts by the threat actors.\"</p>\n<p>It's worth noting at this stage that the backdoor constituent of the LIONTAIL framework is the same as HTTPSnoop owing to the use of the HTTP.sys driver to extract payloads from incoming HTTP traffic.</p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, one intriguing facet of the operation is that the threat actor employs a tailor-made implant for each compromised server, allowing the malicious activities to blend into the victim environment and make it hard to distinguish between suspicious and legitimate network traffic.</p>\n<p>Also deployed alongside LIONTAIL include various web shells and a web forwarder tool called LIONHEAD, a web forwarder.</p>\n<p>Historical activity of Scarred Manticore indicates a continuous evolution of the group's malware arsenal, what with the threat actor previously relying on web shells such as <a href=\"https://github.com/SECFORCE/Tunna/tree/master\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tunna</a> and a bespoke version called FOXSHELL for backdoor access.</p>\n\n<p>Since mid-2020, the threat actor is also said to have used a .NET-based passive backdoor called <a href=\"https://darksys0x.net/Sdd-backdoor/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SDD</a> that establishes C2 communication through an HTTP listener on the infected machine with the ultimate goal of executing arbitrary commands, uploading and downloading files, and running additional .NET assemblies.</p>\n<p>The progressive updates to the threat actor's tactics and tools is typical of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and demonstrates their resources and varied skills. This is best exemplified by Scarred Manticore's use of a malicious kernel driver called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-wintapixsys-malware-engages-in.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WINTAPIX</a> that was uncovered by Fortinet earlier this May.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, WinTapix.sys acts as a loader to execute the next stage of the attack, injecting an embedded shellcode into a suitable user mode process that, in turn, executes an encrypted .NET payload specifically designed to target Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.</p>\n<p>The targeting of Israel comes amid the <a href=\"https://securityscorecard.com/research/hacktivist-involvement-in-israel-hamas-war-reflects-possible-shift-in-threat-actor-focus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing Israel-Hamas war</a>, prompting low-sophistication hacktivist groups to attack various organizations in the country, as well as nations like India and Kenya, suggesting nation-state actors' reliance on information operations aimed at influencing the global perception of the conflict.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in a statement to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/director-wrays-opening-statement-to-the-senate-committee-on-homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs\">warned</a> that the situation has the potential to worsen the \"cyber targeting of American interests and critical infrastructure\" by Iran and non-state actors alike.</p>\n<p>\"LIONTAIL framework components share similar obfuscation and string artifacts with FOXSHELL, SDD backdoor, and WINTAPIX drivers,\" Check Point said.</p>\n<p>\"Examining the history of their activities, it becomes evident how far the threat actor has come in improving their attacks and enhancing their approach which relies on passive implants.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It affects Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments.</p>\n<p>A key hallmark of AvosLocker attacks is the reliance on open-source tools and living-off-the-land (LotL) tactics, leaving no traces that could lead to attribution. Also used are legitimate utilities like FileZilla and Rclone for data exfiltration as well as tunneling tools such as Chisel and Ligolo.</p>\n\n<p>Command-and-control (C2) is accomplished by means of Cobalt Strike and Sliver, while Lazagne and Mimikatz are used for credential theft.

LUCR-3 targets Fortune 2000 companies across various sectors, including but not limited to Software, Retail, Hospitality, Manufacturing, and Telecoms.</p>\n\n<p>LUCR-3 does not rely heavily on malware or even scripts; instead, LUCR-3 expertly uses victims' own tools, applications, and resources to achieve their goals. At a high level, Initial Access is gained through compromising existing identities in the IDP (Okta: Identity Cloud, Azure AD / Entra, Ping Identity: PingOne). LUCR-3 uses SaaS applications such as document portals, ticketing systems, and chat applications to learn how the victim organization operates and how to access sensitive information. Using the data they gained from reconnaissance within the SaaS applications, they then carry out their mission of data theft. Data theft is typically focused on IP, Code Signing Certificates, and customer data.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Attacker Attributes</h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>LUCR-3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTnbCF30b7M\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attribution is difficult</a>. Many of us in the Cyber Intelligence community have even begun to track the individual personas separately. Further confusing attribution, some LUCR-3 personas appear to be affiliates of ALPHV with access to deploy BlackCat ransomware.</li>\n<li>Much like <a href=\"https://permiso.io/blog/s/unmasking-guivil-new-cloud-threat-actor/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LUCR-1 (GUI-Vil)</a>, LUCR-3 tooling, especially in Cloud, SaaS, and CI/CD, mostly uses web browsers and some GUI utilities such as S3 Browser. Leveraging the native features of applications, just like any employee would do, to carry out their goal.</li>\n<li>LUCR-3 heavily targets the IDPs for Initial Access. Buying creds from common marketplaces and bypassing MFA via SIM swapping, social engineering, and push fatigue.</li>\n<li>LUCR-3 does its homework on its initial access victims, choosing identities that will have elevated privileges and even ensuring they source from similar geolocation as their victim identities to avoid impossible travel (geo disparity) alerts.</li>\n<li>LUCR-3 will utilize the victim organizations software deployment solutions, such as SCCM, to deploy specified software to target systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Mission</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 is a financially motivated threat actor that uses data theft of sensitive data (IP, Customer data, Code Signing Certificates) to attempt extortion. While extortion demands do vary, they are often in the tens of millions of dollars. Some personas within LUCR-3 will often collaborate with ALPHV to carry out the extortion phase of the attack.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Tooling</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 utilizes mostly Windows 10 systems running GUI utilities to carry out their mission in the cloud. Using the native features of SaaS applications such as search, LUCR-3 is able to navigate through an organization without raising any alarms. In AWS, the threat actor routinely leverages the S3 Browser (version 10.9.9) and the AWS management console (via a web browser). LUCR-3 utilizes AWS Cloudshell within the AWS management console to carry out any activity that requires direct interaction with the AWS API.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Victimology</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 often targets large (Fortune 2000) organizations that have Intellectual Property (IP) that is valuable enough that victim organizations are likely to pay an extortion fee. Software companies are a common target as they aim to extort a fee related to the theft of source code as well as code signing certificates. LUCR-3 will often target organizations that can be leveraged in a supply chain attack against others. Identity Providers and their outsourced services companies are frequently targeted as a singular compromise of one of these entities will allow for access into multiple other organizations. In recent months, LUCR-3 has expanded its targeting into sectors they haven't previously focused as much on, such as hospitality, gaming, and retail.</p>\n<section class=\"check_two_webinar clear badbox\"><span class=\"wn-label\">Your CloudSec Expert</span><a class=\"wn-head\" href=\"https://hero.permiso.io/lucr-3-scattered-spider-threat-briefing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"wn-title\">LUCR-3 (SCATTERED SPIDER) THREAT BRIEFING</div></a><p class=\"wn-description\">Learn how LUCR-3 (aka Scattered Spider) is compromising IDPs and expanding attacks against laaS, SaaS and CI/CD pipelines.</p><a class=\"wn-button-2\" href=\"https://hero.permiso.io/lucr-3-scattered-spider-threat-briefing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Get a Cloud Threat Briefing</a></section>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Attacker Lifecycle</h2>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxuBP0AhIWr5x7w7dGCrD79ZtdJWCOGqnaHHr_EIA_R4hyphenhyphenzS75cFyhG_GVou38tObGV78s7p_gzWBRn4V_BdaX0bEw2j-VtNj26X-cjlsvDOGs1a2vCON0e2vnmZrv0JOOZ7aLGcnbu_yj0Zkmd5S05bp4X-bpIJdmCN49AzS3dueAq4JHcBvp8o41qRs/s728-rw-e365/lucr.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"AWS Attacker Lifecycle\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"298\" data-original-width=\"728\" data-src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxuBP0AhIWr5x7w7dGCrD79ZtdJWCOGqnaHHr_EIA_R4hyphenhyphenzS75cFyhG_GVou38tObGV78s7p_gzWBRn4V_BdaX0bEw2j-VtNj26X-cjlsvDOGs1a2vCON0e2vnmZrv0JOOZ7aLGcnbu_yj0Zkmd5S05bp4X-bpIJdmCN49AzS3dueAq4JHcBvp8o41qRs/s728-rw-e365/lucr.jpg\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" title=\"AWS Attacker Lifecycle\"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">AWS Attacker Lifecycle</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Initial Recon</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 does their homework when deciding on their target victim identities. They ensure they are targeting users that will have the access they need to carry out their mission. This includes but is not limited to Identity Admins, Developers, Engineers, and the Security team.</p>\n<p>They have been known to leverage credentials that were available in common deep web marketplaces.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Initial Access (IA)</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3's initial access into an environment is gained through compromised credentials. They are not performing noisy activities like password spraying to find passwords. When they connect, they already have a legitimate password to use. The typical approach for them is:</p>\n<p>1. Identify credentials for the intended victim identity</p>\n<p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Buy credentials from common deepweb marketplaces</li><li>Smishing victims to collect their credentials</li><li>Social engineering help desk personnel to gain access to the credentials</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>2. Bypass Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</p>\n<p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>SIM Swapping (when SMS OTP is enabled)</li><li>Push Fatigue (when SMS OTP is not enabled)</li><li>Phishing attacks with redirects to legitimate sites where OTP codes are captured and replayed</li><li>Buy or social engineer access from an insider (last resort)</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>3. Modify MFA settings</p>\n<p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Register a new device</li><li>Add alternative MFA options</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>When LUCR-3 modifies MFA settings, they often register their own mobile device and add secondary MFA options such as emails. Signals to watch for here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a user registers a device that is in a different ecosystem than their previous device (Android to Apple as an example)</li>\n<li>When a user registers a new device that is an older model than their previous device</li>\n<li>When a single phone (device ID) is assigned to multiple identities</li>\n<li>When an external email is added as a multi-factor option</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recon (R)</h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">R-SaaS</h4>\n<p>In order to carry out their goal of data theft, ransom, and extortion, LUCR-3 must understand where the important data is and how to get to it. They perform these tasks much like any employee would. Searching through and viewing documents in various SaaS applications like SharePoint, OneDrive, knowledge applications, ticketing solutions, and chat applications allows LUCR-3 to learn about an environment using native applications without setting off alarm bells. LUCR-3 uses search terms targeted at finding credentials, learning about the software deployment environments, code signing process, and sensitive data.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">R-AWS</h4>\n<p>In AWS, LUCR-3 performs recon in several ways. They will simply navigate around the AWS Management Console into services like Billing, to understand what types of services are being leveraged, and then navigate each of those services in the console. Additionally, LUCR-3 wants to know what packages are running on the compute systems (EC2 instances) in an organization. Leveraging Systems Manager (SSM), LUCR-3 will run the native AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory job against all EC2 instances, returning the software running on the EC2 instances. Lastly, LUCR-3 will leverage the GUI utility S3 Browser in combination with a long-lived access key to view available S3 buckets.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Privilege Escalation (PE)</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 often chooses initial victims who have the type of access necessary to carry out their mission. They do not always need to utilize privilege escalation techniques, but we have observed them do so on occasion in AWS environments.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">PE-AWS</h4>\n<p>LUCR-3 has utilized three (3) main techniques for privilege escalation in AWS:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Policy manipulation: LUCR-3 has been seen modifying the policy of existing roles assigned to EC2 instances ( <i>ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation</i> ) as well as creating new ones with a full open policy.</li>\n<li><i>UpdateLoginProfile</i>: LUCR-3 will update the login profile and, on occasion, create one if it doesn't exist to assign a password to an identity so they can leverage it for AWS Management Console logons.</li>\n<li>SecretsManager Harvesting: Many organizations store credentials in SecretsManger or Terraform Vault for programmatic access from their cloud infrastructure. LUCR-3 will leverage AWS CloudShell to scrape all credentials that are available in SecretsManager and similar solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Establish Persistence/ Maintain Presence (EP)</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3, like most attackers, wants to ensure that they have multiple ways to enter an environment in the event that their initial compromised identities are discovered. In a modern cloud world, there are many ways to achieve this goal, and LUCR-3 employs a myriad to maintain its presence.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">EP-AzureAD/Okta</h4>\n<p>After gaining access to an identity in the IDP (AzureAD, Okta, etc.), LUCR-3 wants to ensure they can easily continue to access the identity. In order to do so, they will often perform the following actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reset/Register Factor: LUCR-3 will register their own device to ease their ability for continued access. As mentioned previously, watch for ecosystem switches for users as well as single devices that are registered to multiple users.</li>\n<li>Alternate MFA: Many IDPs allow for alternate MFA options. LUCR-3 will take advantage of these features to register external emails as a factor. They are smart about choosing a name that aligns with the victim's identity.</li>\n<li>Strong Authentication Type: In environments where the default setting is to not allow for SMS as a factor, LUCR-3 will modify this setting if they are able to. In AzureAD, you can monitor for this by looking for the StrongAuthenticationMethod changing from a 6 (PhoneAppOTP) to a 7 (OneWaySMS)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">EP-AWS</h4>\n<p>To maintain persistence in AWS, LUCR-3 has been observed performing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><i>CreateUser</i>: LUCR-3 will attempt to create IAM Users when available. They choose names that align with the victim identity they are using for initial access into the environment.</li>\n<li><i>CreateAccessKey</i>: LUCR-3 will attempt to create access keys for newly created IAM Users as well as existing IAM Users that they can then use programmatically. Like GUI-Vil (LUCR-1), the access keys that are created are often inputted into the S3 Browser to interact with S3 buckets.</li>\n<li><i>CreateLoginProfile</i> / <i>UpdateLoginProfile</i>: LUCR-3, when trying to be more stealthy or when they do not have access to create new IAM users, will attempt to create or update login profiles for existing users. Login profiles are what assign a password to an IAM User and allow for console access. This technique also lets the attacker gain the privileges of the victim's identity.</li>\n<li>Credential Harvesting: As mentioned previously, LUCR-3 finds great value in harvesting credentials from credential vaults such as AWS SecretsManager and Terraform Vault. These often store credentials not just for the victim organizations but also credentials that may allow access to business partners, technology integrations, and even clients of the victim organization.</li>\n<li>Resource Creation: Lastly, LUCR-3 will create or take over existing resources, such as EC2 instances that can be leveraged for access back into the environment as well as a staging area for tools and data theft as needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">EP-SaaS</h4>\n<p>LUCR-3 will use all the applications available to them to further their goal. In ticketing systems, chat programs, document stores, and knowledge applications, they will often perform searches looking for credentials that can be leveraged during their attack.</p>\n<p>Additionally, many of these applications allow the creation of access tokens that can be used to interact with the SaaS applications API.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">EP-CI/CD</h4>\n<p>LUCR-3 will also generate access tokens for interacting with the APIs of your code repositories, such as GitHub and GitLab.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Defense Evasion (DE)</h3>\n<p>We have observed that LUCR-3 significantly focuses on defense evasion tactics in various environments. This is clearly to avoid detection as long as possible until they are sure they have achieved their mission objectives and are ready to perform ransom and extortion activities. They accomplish this through multiple means depending on the type of environment they are in.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">DE-AWS</h4>\n<p>LUCR-3 employs mostly common defense evasion techniques in AWS, with a couple of unique flares.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disable GuardDuty: LUCR-3 will perform the typical deletion of GuardDuty detectors but also tries to make it harder to add back to the org level by deleting invitations. This is accomplished through the following three commands: <i>DisassociateFromMasterAccount</i>, <i>DeleteInvitations</i>, <i>DeleteDetector</i></li>\n<li>Stop Logging: LUCR-3 also attempts to evade AWS detections by performing <i>DeleteTrail</i> and <i>StopLogging</i> actions.</li>\n<li>Serial Console Access: This may be giving LUCR-3 too much credit, but we have observed them EnableSerialConsoleAccess for AWS accounts they have compromised and then attempt to use EC2 Instance Connect to <i>SendSerialConsoleSSHPublicKey</i> which will attempt to establish a serial connection to a specified EC2 instance. This can be leveraged to avoid network monitoring, as serial connections are hardware-based.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">DE-AzureAD/Okta</h4>\n<p>LUCR-3 clearly understands that one of the more common detections in place for IDPs is to monitor and alert on impossible travel. To avoid these impossible travel detections, LUCR-3 will ensure that they source from a similar geolocation as their victim identity. This seems to be mostly accomplished via the use of residential VPNs.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">DE-M365/Google Workspace</h4>\n<p>Some of LUCR-3's actions in an environment, such as generating tokens and opening up help desk tickets, cause emails to be sent to the victims' mailboxes. LUCR-3, already sitting in those mailboxes, will delete the emails to avoid detection. While email deletion on its own is a very weak signal, looking for email deletions via the web version of Outlook with sensitive terms like OAuth, access token, and MFA might bring to light higher fidelity signals to follow.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Complete Mission (CM)</h3>\n<p>LUCR-3 has one goal: financial gain. They do this mostly through extortion of sensitive data that they have collected via the native tools of the victim organizations' SaaS and CI/CD applications. In AWS, this is accomplished by data theft in S3 and in database applications such as Dynamo and RDS.</p>\n<p>While in the SaaS world, they complete their mission by searching and downloading documents and web pages via a traditional web browser.</p>\n<p>On the CI/CD side, LUCR-3 will use the clone, archive, and view raw features of Github and Gitlab to view and download source data.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Indicators</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Detections</h3>\n<p>Permiso clients are protected by the following detections:</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>The <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> is transforming efficiency in various sectors like healthcare and logistics but has also introduced new security risks, particularly IoT-driven DDoS attacks. This article explores how these attacks work, why they're uniquely problematic, and how to mitigate them.</p>\n<h2>What Is IoT?</h2>\n<p>IoT (Internet of Things) refers to online, interconnected devices that collect and exchange data. This broad category of devices includes sensors, cameras, network routers, and advanced machinery, and their integration into everyday life and work processes results in an ecosystem that can automate operations, improve decision-making, and enhance user experience.</p>\n<h2>IoT: A Breeding Ground for Botnets</h2>\n<p>IoT's rapid adoption amplifies its vulnerability, as poorly secured devices become easy prey for attackers and may become part of a botnet. Controlled by attackers, botnets can scale and rapidly execute various attacks, including DDoS, data theft, ad fraud, cryptocurrency mining, spam and phishing, data harvesting, and snooping\u2014without device owners' knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Why are IoT Botnets a Growing Concern?</h3>\n<p>Botnets are nothing new, but IoT botnets pose a specific threat. The number of IoT devices reached 16 billion in 2022 and is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101442/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expected to exceed 30 billion</a> by 2025. These devices often suffer from infrequent updates or insecure default settings, or are simply left unattended, making them less secure than traditional computers and are at risk of being hijacked with relative ease to form potent botnets.</p>\n<p>The scale and complexity of <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/2023-cyber-threat-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IoT-driven attacks are set to rise</a> due to their increasing use. Among these risks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks stand out as particularly challenging to mitigate. The distributed nature of IoT devices renders them ideal platforms for these attacks, making it difficult to identify and block malicious traffic and thereby compounding the challenges of DDoS mitigation.</p>\n<h2>Anatomy of IoT-Driven botnet DDoS Attacks</h2>\n<p>Let's discuss how IoT <a href=\"https://gcore.com/learning/what-are-ddos-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS attacks </a>happen and how new IoT devices join the ranks of bots. </p>\n<h3>How Are IoT DDoS Attacks Launched?</h3>\n<p>There are several key entities involved in a DDoS botnet attack: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The<strong> attacker </strong>is the person who controls the botnet. They are also known as the bot herder or botmaster.</li>\n<li>A <strong>command-and-control (C&amp;C)</strong> <strong>server</strong> is a computer controlled by the attacker and used to communicate with the infected devices. The C&amp;C orchestrates the botnet's actions, sending out global commands for tasks like initiating an attack or scanning a new device for vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>A <strong>botnet</strong> is a network of devices that have been infected with malware and are controlled by a single attacker.</li>\n<li>The<strong> victim or target</strong> is the focus of a specific botnet-driven attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXPn-tiB4RzBZLdVyEz2W1C7zJ8noNXFX3B7EhxR4RkhlYcswtrpMTadz7Sd82D1Ak2LuZKPP17BPPigG5Dt2RLvMb184iV9Wyq0AI8vb5_Wgx8Ax5Vg3vMKquxuBN2MuLgKViZCSyaIk7pFi7bzttq2diH5qi7tSvRT3le4ERCLKbX4eEW2qnYgRx7Ec/s728-rw-e365/ddos-2.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"DDoS botnet assault flow from attacker's command to DDoS attack\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"333\" data-original-width=\"728\" data-src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXPn-tiB4RzBZLdVyEz2W1C7zJ8noNXFX3B7EhxR4RkhlYcswtrpMTadz7Sd82D1Ak2LuZKPP17BPPigG5Dt2RLvMb184iV9Wyq0AI8vb5_Wgx8Ax5Vg3vMKquxuBN2MuLgKViZCSyaIk7pFi7bzttq2diH5qi7tSvRT3le4ERCLKbX4eEW2qnYgRx7Ec/s728-rw-e365/ddos-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" title=\"DDoS botnet assault flow from attacker's command to DDoS attack\"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">DDoS botnet assault flow from attacker's command to DDoS attack</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The attack process is relatively straightforward:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The attacker targets the botnet to a victim.</strong> The botnet operator identifies the target\u2014usually a device, website, or online service\u2014that they want to take down.</li>\n<li><strong>The C&amp;C server orchestrates the DDoS attack.</strong> The C&amp;C server sends the attacker's instructions to all the bots in the network to start sending requests to the target, and coordinates the botnet's behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>A flood of traffic occurs.</strong> All the bots in the network start sending a large number of requests to the target website or server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the botnet floods the target with excessive requests, service failures occur which jeopardize the availability of the targeted system and even put the integrity of the whole infrastructure at risk. When aimed against essential infrastructures such as healthcare or transportation, the hazards go beyond financial and reputational harm to endangering people's lives.</p>\n<h3>Incorporating IoT Devices into Botnets</h3>\n<p>IoT devices that are <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/articles/iot-vulnerabilities\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unpatched, unattended, or misconfigured</a>, or are already under botnet DDoS attack, are at risk of being incorporated into a botnet. To expand the botnet, an attacker hacks new IoT devices. This process involves two entities: the botnet itself and the loader server, a special server that infects other devices.</p>\n<p>In brief, the process goes like this: The botnet hacks the device and gains access, and then the loader server installs malware on it. The attacker then gains permanent access to the device and attaches it to the botnet. Here are the stages of infecting IoT devices and connecting them to a botnet based the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-mirai-botnet-variant-v3g4.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mirai</a> case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial command:</strong> The attacker uses the C&amp;C server to send a command to the botnet for attacking and incorporating new devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> The C&amp;C server coordinates the botnet's actions.</li>\n<li><strong>Scanning and compromise:</strong> The botnet scans and compromises victim devices to gain privileged access by brute-forcing weak passwords or exploiting outdated firmware or insecure configurations.</li>\n<li><strong>Data reporting: </strong>The botnet relays the victim's IP address and access credentials to the loader server once the device is hacked.</li>\n<li><strong>Malware delivery and infection:</strong> The loader server sends malware or malicious instructions, which are then executed by a compromised device, turning it into a bot.</li>\n<li><strong>Joining the botnet:</strong> The newly infected device becomes part of the botnet and awaits further commands, often operating undetected.</li>\n</ol>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKC8sEYzBXhPSV63p0_bMGdEg5ju14qw7KdS_IpAY8VixvfhdvouoFvUN0zbDhZdHecgF1Y_nChKOCT1xEUzVCBVxIUZRIEXfL0LXLg5tV5Axee0kDYhxu_6JValSXQNKe-LNlNxBWT8HmEjS96VVh4jorNlwuDjTRGHDJFhsgbTeq30FhlvoNf89p_cA/s728-rw-e365/ddos-1.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Process flow, demonstrating scanning, compromising, infecting and joining a new device to a botnet\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"380\" data-original-width=\"728\" data-src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKC8sEYzBXhPSV63p0_bMGdEg5ju14qw7KdS_IpAY8VixvfhdvouoFvUN0zbDhZdHecgF1Y_nChKOCT1xEUzVCBVxIUZRIEXfL0LXLg5tV5Axee0kDYhxu_6JValSXQNKe-LNlNxBWT8HmEjS96VVh4jorNlwuDjTRGHDJFhsgbTeq30FhlvoNf89p_cA/s728-rw-e365/ddos-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" title=\"Process flow, demonstrating scanning, compromising, infecting and joining a new device to a botnet\"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Process flow, demonstrating scanning, compromising, infecting and joining a new device to a botnet</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Advanced botnets can self-propagate, compromising more devices autonomously, bringing more and more devices into the botnet, expanding the botnet's size and amplifying the scale of future attacks.</p>\n<h2>How Dangerous Is the Current IoT DDoS Threat?</h2>\n<p>IoT-driven DDoS attacks <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/networks/security-portfolio/threat-intelligence-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increased by 300%</a> in the first half of 2023 alone, causing an estimated global financial loss of $2.5 billion. In 2023, 90% of complex, multi-vector DDoS attacks were based on botnets. The trend shows no signs of slowing down: the number of IoT devices engaged in botnet-driven DDoS attacks rose from around 200,000 a year ago to approximately<a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2023/06/07/nokia-threat-intelligence-report-finds-malicious-iot-botnet-activity-has-sharply-increased/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1 million devices</a>, while there are <a href=\"https://cujo.com/resources/2022-23-botnet-report-download/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twice as many vulnerabilities</a> being targeted by botnet malware.</p>\n<p>Overall, DDoS attack capacity is on the rise. According to Gcore's Radar 2023, the top power of a singular DDoS attack reached a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/surviving-800-gbps-storm-gain-insights.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staggering 800 Gbps</a> in the first half of 2023. Just two years earlier, it peaked at 300 Gbps. While most attacks hit 1\u20132 Tbps speeds, the most potent <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/networks/security-portfolio/threat-intelligence-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">can reach 100 Tbps</a>.</p>\n<h2>Alarming Projections for 2023\u20132024</h2>\n<p>We are witnessing a <a href=\"https://cujo.com/resources/2022-23-botnet-report-download/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">significant increase</a> in specific DDoS attack vectors, such as UDP reflection and HTTP request flooding, primarily targeting the technology and financial industries. Sectors heavily reliant on online services and real-time data processing are the most attractive targets, facing immediate financial losses and long-term reputational damage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/state-of-the-iot-2020-12-billion-iot-connections-surpassing-non-iot-for-the-first-time/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IoT's advancement</a>, while driving innovation, also brings alarming future trends in cybersecurity: it fuels innovation but also raises significant cybersecurity concerns. With an expected 18% growth in IoT devices to 14.4 billion in 2023, and a projected increase to 27 billion by 2025, experts anticipate a corresponding surge in botnet attacks. With both IoT and DDoS on the rise, IoT DDoS are posed to become an increasingly substantial threat in the immediate future.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Measures: Strategies and Best Practices</h2>\n<p>The rise of more sophisticated and powerful attacks makes immediate attention to security essential. Here's how various stakeholders can contribute to a more secure digital ecosystem:</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1.

architecture, the overall delivery mechanism has remained the same in attacks that were identified in January 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Potential victims landing on one of the compromised websites are greeted by a pop-up message asking them to download an installer for Java Runtime or an antivirus solution, triggering the deployment of a malicious MSI file that, in turn, launches a primary orchestrator module known as ChaesCore.</p>\n<p>The component is responsible for establishing a communication channel with the command-and-control (C2) server from where it fetches additional modules that support post-compromise activity and data theft -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Init</strong>, which gathers extensive information about the system</li>\n<li><strong>Online</strong>, which acts as a beacon to transmit a message back to the attacker that the malware is running on the machine</li>\n<li><strong>Chronod</strong>, which steals login credentials entered in web browsers and intercept BTC, ETH,

Uploader</strong>, which uploads data related to MetaMask's Chrome extension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Persistence on the host is accomplished by means of a scheduled task, while C2 communications entail the use of WebSockets, with the implant running in an infinite loop to await further instructions from the remote server.</p>\n<p>The targeting of cryptocurrency transfers and instant payments via <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/new-botnet-malware-horabot-targets.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brazils' PIX platform</a> is a noteworthy addition that underscores the threat actors' financial motivations.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Chronod module introduces another component used in the framework, a component called Module Packer,\" Morphisec explained. \"This component provides the module its own persistence and migration mechanisms, working much like the ChaesCore's one.\"</p>\n<p>This method involves altering all shortcut files (LNK) associated with web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Avast Secure Browser) to execute the Chronod module instead of the actual browser.</p>\n<p>\"The malware uses Google's DevTools Protocol to connect to the current browser instance,\" the company said. \"This protocol allows direct communication with the inner browser's functionality over WebSockets.\"</p>\n<p>\"The wide range of capabilities exposed by this protocol

During that time, BlackBerry's AI-powered endpoint protection solution, detected and blocked a total of <strong>1,578,733</strong> malware-based cyberattacks targeting customers.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>90 Days of Cyberattacks</strong></h3>\n<p>Based on analysis of cyberattacks detected and blocked during the 90-day window, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team recorded the following statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of malware-based attacks: <strong>1,578,733</strong></li>\n<li>Number of <strong><em>unique</em></strong> attacks (using previously undetected malware): <strong>200,454</strong></li>\n<li>Average number of cyberattacks per day: <strong>17,280</strong></li>\n<li>Average number of cyberattacks per hour: <strong>720</strong></li>\n<li>Average number of attacks per minute: <strong>12</strong></li>\n<li>Average number of new malware variants per minute: <strong>1.5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latest report also analyzes changes in the velocity of cyberattacks detected during this period. The graph below shows a significant peak occurred in early December 2022, followed by a noticeable drop in the last week of the year, as many threat actors and their targets appeared to take a holiday break. Attacks ramped up again as cybercriminals got back to work in the new year.</p>\n<p>The number of new malware variants detected was fairly consistent during the study period. Legacy signature-based antivirus products offer limited value against this steady onslaught of previously unseen attacks, leading many organizations to switch over to AI-based EPP (endpoint protection platform) solutions that have proven to be significantly more effective when <a href=\"https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/04/tolly-tests-reveal-epp-performance-differences?utm_medium=paid_digital&amp;utm_source=thn&amp;utm_campaign=fy24-q2_ues_combat-ransomware-aug-threat-report-paid-thn-tr-pr-art-tdc&amp;utm_content=ca0828\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evaluated by independent testing</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Most-Targeted Industries</strong></h3>\n<p>The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team also identified the most-attacked industries among those customers protected by BlackBerry products. The following data is based on the number of times BlackBerry's zero trust access solution, CylanceEDGE\u2122, stopped cyberattacks targeting organizations in various sectors.</p>\n<p>The most-targeted industries during the study period included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Financial institutions</li>\n<li>Healthcare services and equipment, including hospitals, clinics, and medical devices</li>\n<li>Food and staples retailers, including supermarkets, drugstores, and companies that sell food products to other businesses</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The report found these vertical industries accounted for <strong>60%</strong> of the overall number of attacks. BlackBerry threat researchers also analyzed the types of malware deployed against these verticals.</p>\n<p>The report reveals CylanceEDGE blocked <strong>231,510</strong> malware attacks against the financial services industry, with an average of <strong>2,601</strong> malware-based attacks attempted per day. Previously undetected malware variants appeared in <strong>34 unique attacks</strong> each day. This data helped researchers ascertain that Metasploit\u00ae, an open-source pen-testing application, remains one of the most popular tools abused by threat actors targeting this industry.</p>\n<p>Cyberattacks against the healthcare industry totaled <strong>93,000</strong> of the blocked attacks. These included <strong>5,246</strong> unique malware samples used against the healthcare vertical, averaging <strong>59</strong> previously undetected variants neutralized by BlackBerry technologies each day. The report notes an increase in use of the Emotet Trojan, the adversary simulation tool Cobalt Strike, and pervasive ransomware variants such as BlackCat being deployed against the healthcare industry during the reporting period.</p>\n<p>Attacks against retail and retail supply chains comprised <strong>12% of attempted intrusions</strong> stopped by BlackBerry endpoint security solutions. These industries provide essential services, and any failure in their ecosystems can lead to serious consequences that reverberate not only locally but also throughout the region, the country, or indeed the world. Increasing digital transformation and interconnectedness within and among industry verticals raise risks even higher.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What the Numbers Tell Us</strong></h2>\n<p>Cybersecurity practitioners across numerous industries continue to struggle against a rising tide of fast-moving, sophisticated cyberthreats. BlackBerry's CTO Shishir Singh asserts that the emergence of <a href=\"https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/05/defining-cybersecuritys-third-generation?utm_medium=paid_digital&amp;utm_source=thn&amp;utm_campaign=fy24-q2_ues_combat-ransomware-aug-threat-report-paid-thn-tr-pr-art-tdc&amp;utm_content=ca0828\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity's third generation</a> will help, by ushering in more predictive defensive capabilities, fueled by further advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. As these technologies mature, however, organizations are encouraged to increase their focus on prioritizing existing defenses based on <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security/cylance-intelligence?utm_medium=paid_digital&amp;utm_source=thn&amp;utm_campaign=fy24-q2_ues_combat-ransomware-aug-threat-report-paid-thn-tr-pr-art-tdc&amp;utm_content=ca0828\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">contextualized cyber threat intelligence</a> (CTI).

This makes it possible to intercept SMS messages and voice calls and receive MFA-related messages that control access to online accounts.</p>\n<p>Fraudsters accomplish this by often using phishing or social media to collect personal information about their targets, such as birthdays, mother's maiden names, and the high schools they went to, so that they can convince the cellular carrier to port the victims' phone numbers to one of their own SIM cards.</p>\n<p>The company noted that it took immediate steps to secure the three affected accounts and that it has notified impacted individuals by email. While an investigation is underway, Kroll said it found no evidence to indicate that other systems or accounts have been affected.</p>\n\n<p>The disclosure arrives days after Bart Stephens, the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2023/08/21/blockchain-capitals-bart-stephens-lost-63-million-in-sim-swap-crypto-hack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a lawsuit</a> against an anonymous hacker who stole $6.3 million worth of crypto in an alleged SIM swap attack.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/two-lapsus-hackers-convicted-in-london.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urged</a> telecommunications providers to employ stronger security protocols to prevent SIM swapping, including by providing options for customers to lock their accounts and enforcing stringent identity verification checks.</p>\n<p>If anything, the <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208\" target=\"_blank\">frequency of SIM swapping attacks</a> is a reminder for users to move away from SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and switch to phishing-resistant methods to secure online accounts.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Kurtaj was subsequently granted bail and moved to a hotel in Bicester after he was doxxed in an online cybercrime forum.</p>\n<p>He, however, continued his hacking spree, targeting companies like <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/uber-blames-lapsus-hacking-group-for.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uber</a>, <a href=\"https://vdai.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/valstybine-duomenu-apsaugos-inspekcija-pradejo-tyrima-del-revolut-asmens-duomenu-saugumo-pazeidimo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Revolut</a>, and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/rockstar-games-confirms-hacker-stole.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rockstar Games</a>, as a result of which he was <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/london-police-arrested-17-year-old.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">arrested again</a> in September. Another alleged member of the group was <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/brazilian-police-arrest-suspected.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apprehended by Brazilian authorities</a> in October 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Central to pulling off the extortion schemes was their ability to conduct SIM swapping and prompt bombing attacks to gain unauthorized access to corporate networks after an extensive social engineering phase.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tenable.com/blog/brazen-unsophisticated-and-illogical-understanding-the-lapsus-extortion-group\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">financially motivated operation</a> also entailed posting messages to their Telegram channel to solicit rogue insiders who can provide Virtual Private Network (VPN), Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), or Citrix credentials to organizations.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/08/10/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-activities-global-extortion-focused\">recent report</a> from the U.S. government found that the actors offered as much as $20,000 per week for access to telecommunications providers so as to carry out the SIM swap attacks. It characterized LAPSUS$ as unique for its \"effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness,\" and for weaponizing a \"playbook of effective techniques.\"</p>\n<p>\"To execute fraudulent SIM swaps, LAPSUS$ obtained basic information about its victims, such as their name, phone number, and customer proprietary network information (CPNI),\" the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/review-attacks-associated-lapsus-and-related-threat-groups-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>\"LAPSUS$ learned the information through a variety of ways, including issuing <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/\" target=\"_blank\">fraudulent [Emergency Disclosure Requests]</a>, and using account takeover techniques, to hijack the accounts of telecommunications provider employees and contractors.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It then performed fraudulent SIM swaps via the telecommunications provider's customer management tools. After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, LAPSUS$ took over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via SMS or voice calls.\"</p>\n<p>Other methods of initial access ranged from employing the services of initial access brokers (IABs) to the exploitation of security flaws, following which the actors took steps to escalate privileges, laterally move across the network, set up persistent access via remote desktop software such as AnyDesk and TeamViewer, and disable security monitoring tools.</p>\n<p>Among the firms infiltrated by LAPSUS$ comprised BT, EE, Globant, LG, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Okta, Samsung, Ubisoft, and Vodafone. It's currently unclear whether ransoms were paid by any of the breached companies. The teenagers are expected to be sentenced at a later date.</p>\n<p>\"The group gained notoriety because it successfully attacked well-defended organizations using highly effective social engineering; targeted supply chains by compromising business process outsourcing (BPOs) and telecommunications providers; and used its public Telegram channel to discuss its operations, targets, and successes, and even to communicate with and extort its targets,\" the CSRB said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

TP-Link has <a href=\"https://www.tp-link.com/en/support/faq/3722/\">released</a> new firmware to address the issues.</p>\n<p>It also follows the discovery of a new attack technique dubbed TunnelCrack, which leverages two security issues named LocalNet and ServerIP, to leak traffic outside a protected VPN tunnel when connecting to an untrusted Wi-Fi network or a rogue ISP, thereby exposing users to adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) scenarios.</p>\n<p>\"The attacks manipulate the victim's routing table to trick the victim into sending traffic outside the protected VPN tunnel, allowing an adversary to read and intercept transmitted traffic,\" a group of researchers from KU Leuven, NYU, and NYU Abu Dhabi <a href=\"https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/\">said</a>.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

A macOS variant of the malware emerged in July 2021, distributed as a Java program in the form of a compiled .JAR file.</p>\n\n<p>\"Such files require the Java Runtime Environment, and for that reason the malicious .jar file will not execute on a macOS install out of the box, since Apple stopped shipping JRE with Macs over a decade ago,\" the cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/detecting-xloader-a-macos-malware-as-a-service-info-stealer-and-keylogger/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> at the time.</p>\n<p>The latest iteration of XLoader gets around this limitation by switching to programming languages such as C and Objective C, with the disk image file signed on July 17, 2023.

The distribution of Disco, on the other hand, is accomplished by means of an AitM attack.</p>\n<p>\"To compromise their targets, MoustachedBouncer operators tamper with their victims' internet access, probably at the ISP level, to make Windows believe it's behind a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">captive portal</a>,\" Faou said. \"For IP ranges targeted by MoustachedBouncer, the network traffic is tampered at the ISP level, and the latter URL redirects to a seemingly legitimate, but fake, Windows Update URL.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"While the compromise of routers in order to conduct AitM on embassy networks cannot be fully discarded, the presence of lawful interception capabilities in Belarus suggests the traffic mangling is happening at the ISP level rather than on the targets' routers,\" Fou said.</p>\n<p>Two Belarusian internet service providers (ISPs), viz Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom, are suspected to be involved in the campaign, per the Slovak cybersecurity company.</p>\n<p>Victims who land on the bogus page are greeted with a message urging them to install critical security updates by clicking on a button. In doing so, a rogue Go-based \"Windows Update\" installer is downloaded to the machine that, when executed, sets up a scheduled task to run another downloader binary responsible for fetching additional plugins.</p>\n<p>The add-ons expand on Disco's functionality by capturing screenshots every 15 seconds, executing PowerShell scripts, and setting up a reverse proxy.</p>\n<p>A significant aspect of the plugins is the use of the Server Message Block (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SMB</a>) protocol for data exfiltration to command-and-control servers that are inaccessible over the internet, making the threat actor's infrastructure highly resilient.</p>\n\n<p>Also used in the January 2020 attack aimed at diplomats of a Northeast African country in Belarus is a C# dropper referred to as SharpDisco, which facilitates the deployment of two plugins by means of a reverse shell in order to enumerate connected drives and exfiltrate files.</p>\n<p>The NightClub framework also comprises a dropper that, in turn, launches an orchestrator component to harvest files of interest and transmit them over the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">SMTP</a>). Subsequent iterations of NightClub unearthed in 2017 and 2020 also incorporate a keylogger, audio recorder, screenshotter, and a DNS-tunneling backdoor.</p>\n<p>\"The DNS-tunneling backdoor (ParametersParserer.dll) uses a custom protocol to send and receive data from a malicious DNS server,\" Faou explained. \"The plugin adds the data to exfiltrate as part of the subdomain name of the domain that is used in the DNS request.\"</p>\n<p>The commands supported by the modular implant allow the threat actor to search for files matching a specific pattern, read, copy, and remove files, write to files, copy directories, and create arbitrary processes.</p>\n<p>It's believed that NightClub is used in scenarios where traffic interception at the ISP level isn't possible because of anonymity-boosting mitigations such as the use of an end-to-end encrypted VPN where internet traffic is routed outside of Belarus.</p>\n<p>\"The main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection devices,\" Faou said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Porsche has a well-established Vulnerability Reporting Policy (Disclosure Policy)<span class=\"superscript\">[1]</span>, it was considered in scope for our research, so we decided to start there, and see what we could find.</p>\n<p>What we found is an attack scenario that results from chaining security issues found on different Porsche's assets, a website and a GraphQL API, that could lead to data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is an attack technique that can impact businesses and organizations, regardless of size. When malicious users breach a company's or organization's systems and exfiltrate data, it can be a jarring and business-critical moment.</p>\n<p>Porsche has a diverse online presence - deploying several microsites, websites, and web applications. The Porsche Experience <span class=\"superscript\">[2]</span> is one website that allows registered users to manage a virtual garage, book experiences (such as track days), as well as manage bookings and invoices. From a technical perspective this website is a single-page application (SPA) backed by a GraphQL API (https://experience.porsche.com/graphql) used to fetch data and perform operations such as user authentication, user profile updates, book events, etc.</p>\n<p>While initially exploring the website, the team noticed some interesting API requests. More specifically the jwtToken cookie and the Appauthorization HTTP request header both had the same value.</p>\n\n<p>The image above shows the original API request issued by the website front-end to retrieve the user profile after a successful login attempt. On the left (Request) you can see the duplicate value.</p>\n<p>This was enough to produce a hypothetical Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) <span class=\"superscript\">[3]</span> attack scenario, leading us to wonder whether the API would look for the authentication token in the jwtToken cookie if the custom HTTP request header Appauthorization was missing.</p>\n<p>Including API auth tokens in a request header, rather than Cookie, are a game changer for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Web browsers, unlike cookies, do not include such headers automatically, which must be done by some front-end custom logic (JavaScript). </p>\n<p>To answer our question, we replayed the original request without including the Appauthorization request header. When we received the same response back from the API server, we confirmed our theory: the API retrieves the auth token from cookies when the custom request header is not present.</p>\n\n<p>We had another question in mind that also needed to be answered: would the API server allow requests from origins other than porsche.com?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question was also a resounding \"yes.\" </p>\n<p>As you can see in the image above, the request was made from a different website, which is reflected in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin <span class=\"superscript\">[4]</span> response header, indicating that the response can be shared with the requesting code from the given origin. Moreover, the API server also tells browsers to expose the response to the front-end JavaScript code when the request's credentials mode is include <span class=\"superscript\">[5]</span>.</p>\n<p>Typically, to be able to perpetrate a CSRF attack from an attacker's-controlled website the victims' web browsers must automatically include the jwtToken cookie in the API requests. That was not the case for Porsche Experience: the jwtToken cookie SameSite attribute was set to Lax. </p>\n\n<p>The SameSite attribute <span class=\"superscript\">[6]</span> controls whether a cookie should be sent with cross-site requests providing some protection against CSRF attacks. Lax means that the cookie is not sent on cross-site requests<span class=\"superscript\">[7]</span>, and it is the default value when not specified at the time the cookie is set. We would not be able to make request to GraphQL API from a website controlled by us, but the definition of \"Site\" and \"Same Site\" <span class=\"superscript\">[8]</span> still leaves us an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Any website served from a subdomain of porsche.com using HTTPS is considered \"Same Site\", and the jwtToken is automatically included by web browsers in requests to the API. Then, all we need to exfiltrate data from the API is to find a way to lead a Porsche website to issue API requests to our target API, sending the response to a server controlled by us. We should not expect to find such a feature on a Porsche website, but a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability <span class=\"superscript\">[9]</span> would allow us to do it.</p>\n<p>The initial reconnaissance process gave us a comprehensive list of Porsche websites which we considered in our research. campaigns.porsche.com was a vulnerable website and the most credible to be included in a \"marketing campaign\" phishing email.</p>\n\n<p>The /charging/WebAjaxGet endpoint of the vulnerable website (campaigns.porsche.com) did not properly sanitize nor encode query string parameter values before including them in the HTML server response. Bad actors could have exploited this issue to inject arbitrary code into the server response, which would end up being executed by the web browser into the victims' session context. Below is the special crafted URL that triggered the alert dialog box in the image above:</p>\n\n<p>To exfiltrate data from the API to a remote server, controlled by us, we needed a more complex JavaScript logic. We ended up exploiting the Reflected XSS vulnerability to load a JavaScript script from our remote server. This is how the payload looks like:</p>\n\n<p>The snippet simply creates a script element, setting the src attribute with the address where our malicious script should be fetched from. When appending it to the Document Object Model (DOM) the script is then downloaded and executed. To avoid encoding issues, the JavaScript payload was encoded base64, and appended to the URL as an argument of the atob JavaScript function, whose output is passed to the eval function. This is how the final crafted URL looks like:</p>\n\n<p>The next step was to write the malicious exfiltrate.js script, downloaded and executed by our XSS payload. For victims, with an active session on experience.porsche.com, the jwtToken auth cookie is automatically included in requests to the API. All we need is to trigger the request with the appropriate GraphQL query and send the response to our remote server. To make the attack a bit sturdier, after that we will redirect the browser to the Porsche Experience website.</p>\n\n<p>With everything in place, and working properly, malicious actors would need to deliver the final malicious URL to victims, enticing them to click it. Email phishing is certainly the most common way attackers do it. The image below illustrates such a phishing email: instead of trying to hide the URL, attacker may have taken advantage of the fact that it starts with HTTPS, and it is an actual porsche.com website.</p>\n\n<p>This attack scenario is not theoretical, and you can watch the proof-of-concept video provided to Porsche on YouTube <span class=\"superscript\">[10]</span>.</p>\n<p>Although this proof-of-concept focuses on profile data exfiltration the loaded JavaScript script could include other logic to retrieve additional data from the GraphQL API (e.g., invoices) or perform actions on victims' behalf (e.g., booking or cancel events).</p>\n<p>Some quick security tips:</p>\n<p> To prevent XSS <span class=\"superscript\">[11]</span> always encode unsafe data, according to the context to which it will be written to. On the APIs side, always establish a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy <span class=\"superscript\">[12]</span> that restricts what hosts are allowed to interact with it. Also properly set cookies' options, and whenever possible, avoid using cookies to exchange auth tokens between clients and the API server.</p>\n<p>It was a pleasure to collaborate with Porsche who took ownership and were professional throughout the disclosure and remediation process. For this reason, and a great researcher experience, we're granting Porsche the Checkmarx Seal of Approval.</p>\n<p>And, as always, our security research team will continue to focus on ways to <a href=\"https://info.checkmarx.com/a-platform-approach-to-shift-everywhere-in-devops?utm_source=TheHackeNews&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=X-AD-20230424-ALL_LEVEL-THN-ALL-PER-DISPLAY-LP&amp;utm_search_query=shift-everywhere-whitepaper\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>improve application security practices</b></a> everywhere.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

I think companies and investors alike, however, would benefit if this disclosure were made in a more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful way.\"</p>\n<p>To that end, the new obligations mandate that companies reveal the incident's nature, scope, and timing, as well as its impact. This disclosure, however, may be delayed by an additional period of up to 60 days should it be determined that giving out such specifics \"would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety.\"</p>\n<p>They also necessitate registrants to describe on an annual basis the methods and strategies used for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, detail the material effects or risks arising as a result of those events, and share information about ongoing or completed remediation efforts.</p>\n\n<p>\"The key word here is 'material' and being able to determine what that actually means,\" Safe Security CEO Saket Modi told The Hacker News. \"Most organizations are not prepared to comply with the SEC guidelines as they cannot determine materiality, which is core to shareholder protection. They lack the systems to quantify risk at broad and granular levels.\"</p>\n<p>That said, the rules do not extend to \"specific, technical information about the registrant's planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrant's response or remediation of the incident.\"</p>\n<p>The policy, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-39\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first proposed</a> in March 2022, is seen as an effort to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/lizarraga-statement-cybersecurity-072623\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bring more transparency</a> into the threats faced by U.S. companies from cybercrime and nation-state actors, close the gaps in cybersecurity defense and disclosure practices, and harden the systems against data theft and intrusions.</p>\n<p>In recent months, <a href=\"https://konbriefing.com/en-topics/cyber-attacks-moveit-victim-list.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than 500 companies</a> have become victims of a <a href=\"https://www.emsisoft.com/en/blog/44123/unpacking-the-moveit-breach-statistics-and-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyber attack spree</a> orchestrated by a ransomware gang called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/mallox-ransomware-exploits-weak-ms-sql.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cl0p</a>, propelled by the exploitation of critical flaws in software widely used in enterprise environments, with the threat actors leveraging <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/moveit-vulnerability-investigations-uncover-additional-exfiltration-method\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new exfiltration methods</a> to steal data, according to Kroll.</p>\n<p>Tenable CEO and Chairman, Amit Yoran, said the new rules on cyber risk management and incident disclosure is \"right on the money\" and that they are a \"dramatic step toward greater transparency and accountability.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"When cyber breaches have real-life consequences and reputational costs, investors should have the right to know about an organization's cyber risk management activities,\" Yoran added.</p>\n<p>That said, concerns have been raised that the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/companies-have-4-day-deadline-to-report-hacks-in-final-sec-rule\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">time frame is too tight</a>, leading to possibly inaccurate disclosures, given that it may take companies weeks or even months to fully investigate a breach. To complicate the matter further, premature breach notifications could tip off other attackers to a susceptible target and exacerbate security risks.</p>\n<p>\"The new requirement set forth by the SEC requiring organizations to report cyber attacks or incidents within four days seems aggressive but sits in a more lax time frame than other countries,\" James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said.</p>\n<p>\"Within the E.U., the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and Australia, companies have <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">72 hours</a> to report a cyber incident.

But it's unclear if the key functioned as a master key of sorts to unlock access to data belonging to nearly two dozen organizations.</p>\n<p>Wiz's analysis fills in some of the blanks, with the company discovering that \"all Azure personal account v2.0 applications depend on a list of <a href=\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/discovery/v2.0/keys\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8 public keys</a>, and all Azure multi-tenant v2.0 applications with Microsoft account enabled depend on a list of <a href=\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">7 public keys</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>It further found that Microsoft replaced one of the the listed public keys (thumbprint: \"d4b4cccda9228624656bff33d8110955779632aa\") that had been present <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160801114452/https:/login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">since at least 2016</a> sometime between June 27, 2023, and July 5, 2023, around the same period the company said it had revoked the MSA key.</p>\n<p>\"This led us to believe that although the compromised key acquired by Storm-0558 was a private key designed for Microsoft's MSA tenant in Azure, it was also able to sign OpenID v2.0 tokens for multiple types of Azure Active Directory applications,\" Wiz said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Storm-0558 seemingly managed to obtain access to one of several keys that were intended for signing and verifying AAD access tokens. The compromised key was trusted to sign any OpenID v2.0 access token for personal accounts and mixed-audience (multi-tenant or personal account) AAD applications.\"</p>\n<p>This effectively meant that the loophole could theoretically enable malicious actors to forge access tokens for consumption by any application that depends on the Azure identity platform.</p>\n<p>Even worse, the acquired private key could have been weaponized to forge tokens to authenticate as any user to an affected application that trusts Microsoft OpenID v2.0 mixed audience and personal-accounts certificates.</p>\n<p>\"Identity provider's signing keys are probably the most powerful secrets in the modern world,\" Wiz security researcher Shir Tamari said. \"With identity provider keys, one can gain immediate single hop access to everything, any email box, file service, or cloud account.\"</p>\n<h3>Update</h3>\n<p>When reached for comment, Microsoft shared the following statement with The Hacker News -</p>\n<p><em>Many of the claims made in this blog are speculative and not evidence-based.

Among these, three vulnerabilities have been identified as actively exploited in targeted attacks.</p>\n<p>One of the vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2023-26083 is a memory leak flaw affecting the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips. This particular vulnerability was exploited in a previous attack that enabled <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/spyware-vendors-caught-exploiting-zero.html\" target=\"_blank\">spyware infiltration on Samsung devices</a> in December 2022.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability was regarded as serious enough to prompt the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/cisa-warns-of-5-actively-exploited.html\" target=\"_blank\">patching order for federal agencies</a> in April 2023.</p>\n<p>Another significant vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-29256, is a high-severity issue that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers. This flaw permits an unprivileged user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and escalate privileges to the root level.</p>\n\n<p>The third exploited vulnerability, CVE-2023-2136, is a critical-severity bug discovered in Skia, Google's open-source multi-platform 2D graphics library. It was initially disclosed as a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/google-chrome-hit-by-second-zero-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">zero-day vulnerability in the Chrome browser</a> and allows a remote attacker who has taken over the renderer process to perform a sandbox escape and implement remote code on Android devices.</p>\n<p>Besides these, Google's July Android security bulletin highlights another critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-21250, affecting the Android System component. This issue can cause remote code execution without user interaction or additional execution privileges, making it particularly precarious.</p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-07-01\" target=\"_blank\">security updates</a> are rolled out in two patch levels. The initial patch level, made available on July 1, focuses on core Android components, addressing 22 security defects in the Framework and System components.</p>\n\n<p>The second patch level, released on July 5, targets kernel and closed source components, tackling 20 vulnerabilities in Kernel, Arm, Imagination Technologies, MediaTek, and Qualcomm components.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the impact of the addressed vulnerabilities may extend beyond the supported Android versions (11, 12, and 13), potentially affecting older OS versions no longer receive official support.</p>\n<p>Google has further launched particular security patches for its Pixel devices, dealing with 14 vulnerabilities in Kernel, Pixel, and Qualcomm components. Two of these critical weaknesses could result in privilege elevation and denial-of-service attacks.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The targeting aligns with the interest of China-based threat actors.</p>\n<p>In the early phases, the operation relied on readily available remote access and post-exploitation tools like AsyncRAT and Cobalt Strike, before transitioning to bespoke malware in late 2021 or early 2022 in a bid to thwart detection.</p>\n<p>A primary evasion tactic concerns the use of Microsoft Windows folders that are likely to be excluded from scanning by security software (e.g., System32 and Program Files) to store the backdoor payloads.</p>\n\n<p>One of the sub-folders in question is \"C:\\Program Files\\Dell\\CommandUpdate,\" which is the directory for a legitimate Dell application called <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000177325/dell-command-update\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Command | Update</a>.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender said all the machines infected over the course of the incident were manufactured by Dell, suggesting that the threat actors deliberately chose this folder to camouflage the malicious activity.</p>\n<p>This line of reasoning is bolstered by the fact that the threat actor registered command-and-control (C2) domains such as \"dell-a[.]ntp-update[.]com\" with the goal of blending in with the target environment.</p>\n<p>The intrusion set is characterized by the use of a server-side backdoor called RDStealer, which specializes in continuously gathering clipboard content and keystroke data from the host. It's currently not known how the RDP servers are compromised in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>But what makes it stand out is its capability to \"monitor incoming RDP [Remote Desktop Protocol] connections and compromise a remote machine if <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/terminal-services-virtual-channels\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">client drive mapping</a> is enabled.\"</p>\n<p>Thus when a new RDP client connection is detected, commands are issued by RDStealer to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as browsing history, credentials, and private keys from apps like mRemoteNG, KeePass, and Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>\"This highlights the fact that threat actors actively seek credentials and saved connections to other systems,\" Bitdefender's Marin Zugec <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/businessinsights/unpacking-rdstealer-an-exfiltration-malware-targeting-rdp-workloads/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a second analysis.</p>\n\n<p>What's more, the connecting RDP clients are infected with another Golang-based custom malware known as Logutil to maintain a persistent foothold on the victim network using <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/businessinsights/tech-explainer-what-is-dll-sideloading/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DLL side-loading techniques</a> and facilitate command execution.</p>\n<p>Not much is known about the threat actor other than the fact that it has been active dating back to at least 2020 and that they have the sophistication of a state-sponsored threat.</p>\n<p>\"Cybercriminals continually innovate and explore novel methods to enhance the reliability and stealthiness of their malicious activities,\" Zugec said.</p>\n<p>\"This attack serves as a testament to the increasing sophistication of modern cyber attacks, but also underscores the fact that threat actors can leverage their newfound sophistication to exploit older, widely adopted technologies.\"</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

That said, it's suspected the hacking crew's victimology footprint could be broader than previously assumed.</p>\n<p>While the latest discovery brings the attack tally to 13 (counting the five new victims) since mid-2021, they also indicate the adversary's attempts to maintain a low profile for stealthiness. They are also a sign of the threat actors carefully selecting their targets and keeping the number of attacks at a minimum to reduce the likelihood of exposure.</p>\n<p>\"The fact that two attacks were executed in 2023 indicates that Dark Pink remains active and poses an ongoing risk to organizations,\" Polovinkin said. \"Evidence shows that the cybercriminals behind these attacks keep updating their existing tools in order to remain undetected.\"</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Exactly how and when the telecommunication network was infiltrated is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>\"Operation Paperbug aligns with the common trend of attacking into Central Asia government infrastructure that recently became more prominent,\" PRODAFT noted.</p>\n<p>Nomadic Octopus is believed to exhibit some level of cooperation with another Russian nation-state actor known as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/us-and-uk-warn-of-russian-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sofacy</a> (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, or FROZENLAKE), based on <a href=\"https://securelist.com/a-slice-of-2017-sofacy-activity/83930/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">victimology</a> <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/russian-apt28-hackers-using-covid-19-as.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overlaps</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest attacks further entailed the use of an Octopus variant that comes with features to take screenshots, run commands remotely, and download and upload files to and from the infected host to a remote server.

To that end, CIS countries, as well as morgues, hospitals, COVID-19 vaccine-related corporations, critical infrastructure, law enforcement, and other prominent companies are off-limits for the group.</p>\n<p>\"The RTM gang's goal is to attract as little attention as possible, which is where the rules help them to avoid hitting high-value targets,\" security researcher Max Kersten said. \"Their management of affiliates to accomplish that goal requires some level of sophistication, though it's not a high level per se.\"</p>\n\n<p>RTM Locker malware builds are bound by strict mandates that forbid affiliates from leaking the samples, or else risk facing a ban. Among the other rules laid out is a clause that locks out affiliates should they remain inactive for 10 days sans a notification upfront.</p>\n<p>\"The effort the gang put into avoiding drawing attention was the most unusual,\" Kersten explained. \"The affiliates need to be active as well, making it harder for researchers to infiltrate the gang. All in all, the gang's specific efforts in this area are higher than normally observed compared to other ransomware groups.\"</p>\n<p>It's suspected that the locker is executed on networks that are already under the adversary's control, indicating that the systems may have been compromised by other means, such as phishing attacks, malspam, or the exploitation of internet-exposed vulnerable servers.</p>\n<p>The threat actor, like other RaaS groups, uses extortion techniques to compel victims into paying up. The payload, for its part, is capable of elevating privileges, terminating antivirus and backup services, and deleting shadow copies before commencing its encryption procedure.</p>\n<p>It's also designed to empty the Recycle Bin to prevent recovery, change the wallpaper, wipe event logs, and execute a shell command that self-deletes the locker as a last step.</p>\n<p>The findings suggest that cybercrime groups will continue to \"adopt new tactics and methods to avoid the headlines and help them fly under the radar of researchers and law enforcement alike,\" Kersten noted.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It's worth noting that the DeathNote cluster is also tracked under the monikers <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-koreas-lazarus-hackers-targeting.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Dream Job</a> or <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/hackers-exploiting-vmware-horizon-to.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NukeSped</a>.

The Lazarus Group's use of rogue PDF reader apps was <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-hackers-weaponizing-open.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously revealed</a> by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>The targets of these attacks included an IT asset monitoring solution vendor based in Latvia and a think tank located in South Korea, the latter of which entailed the abuse of legitimate security software that's widely used in the country to execute the payloads.</p>\n\n<p>The twin attacks \"point to Lazarus building supply chain attack capabilities,\" Kaspersky noted at the time. The adversarial crew <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-sub-group-labyrinth-chollima.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has since been blamed</a> for the supply chain attack aimed at enterprise VoIP service provider 3CX that came to light last month.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky said it discovered another attack in March 2022 that targeted several victims in South Korea by exploiting the same security software to deliver downloader malware capable of distributing a backdoor as well as an information stealer for harvesting keystroke and clipboard data.</p>\n<p>\"The newly implanted backdoor is capable of executing a retrieved payload with named-pipe communication,\" Park said, adding it's also \"responsible for collecting and reporting the victim's information.\"</p>\n<p>Around the same time, the same backdoor is said to have been utilized to compromise a defense contractor in Latin America using DLL side-loading techniques upon opening a specially-crafted PDF file using a trojanized PDF reader.</p>\n<p>The Lazarus Group has also been linked to a successful breach of another defense contractor in Africa last July in which a \"suspicious PDF application\" was sent over Skype to ultimately drop a variant of a backdoor dubbed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/north-korean-hackers-targeting-defense.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ThreatNeedle</a> and another implant known as ForestTiger to exfiltrate data.</p>\n<p>\"The Lazarus group is a notorious and highly skilled threat actor,\" Park said. \"As the Lazarus group continues to refine its approaches, it is crucial for organizations to maintain vigilance and take proactive measures to defend against its malicious activities.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The Israel National Cyber Directorate, last month, <a href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/_muddywater\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attributed</a> the attack to MuddyWater.</p>\n\n<p>\"DEV-1084 [...] presented itself as a criminal actor interested in extortion, likely as an attempt to obfuscate Iran's link to and strategic motivation for the attack,\" Microsoft added.</p>\n<p>The links between Mercury and DEV-1084 originate from infrastructure, IP address, and tooling overlaps, with the latter observed using a reverse tunneling utility called <a href=\"https://github.com/sysdream/ligolo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ligolo</a>, a staple <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/russian-ransomware-gang-retool-custom.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MuddyWater artifact</a>.</p>\n<p>That said, there is not ample evidence to determine if DEV-1084 operates independently of MuddyWater and collaborates with other Iranian actors, or if it's a sub-team that's only summoned when there is a need to conduct a destructive attack.</p>\n<p>Cisco Talos, early last year, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/iranian-hackers-targeting-turkey-and.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> MuddyWater as a \"conglomerate\" comprising several smaller clusters rather than a single, cohesive group. The emergence of DEV-1084 suggests a nod in this direction.</p>\n<p>\"While these teams seem to operate independently, they are all motivated by the same factors that align with Iranian national security objectives, including espionage, intellectual theft, and destructive or disruptive operations based on the victims they target,\" Talos noted in March 2022.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>Every year hundreds of millions of malware attacks occur worldwide, and every year businesses deal with the impact of viruses, worms, keyloggers, and ransomware. Malware is a pernicious threat and the biggest driver for businesses to look for cybersecurity solutions. </p>\n<p>Naturally, businesses want to find products that will stop malware in its tracks, and so they search for solutions to do that. But <a href=\"https://www.perimeter81.com/malware-protection?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_term=secure_internet_access&amp;utm_campaign=contributed_article_Mar23\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>malware protection</b></a> alone is not enough, instead what's needed is a more holistic approach. Businesses need to defend against malware entering the network, and then on top of that have systems and processes in place to restrict the damage that malware can do if it infects a user device. </p>\n<p>This approach will not only help stop and mitigate the damage from malware, but defend against other types of threats too, such as credential theft as a result of phishing, insider threats, and supply-chain attacks. </p>\n<h2>Element 1: Malware Protection and Web Filtering</h2>\n<p>The first and most sensible place to begin is with anti-malware solutions. It's important to look for malware solutions that can confront today's key threats, such as known malware, polymorphic variants, ransomware, zero-day exploits, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This requires a strong toolkit of virus signature databases, virtual code execution, as well as heuristics and other machine learning techniques.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you would also use malware protection for both the network and the endpoint. This requires two different solutions, but a multi-layered approach means less chance of something getting through.</p>\n<p>In addition to Malware Protection, Web Filtering keeps your employees away from potential threats by disallowing known malicious sites, questionable sites, and other places online you'd rather not have managed devices visit. </p>\n<h2>Element 2: Zero Trust Network Access</h2>\n<p>Every security strategy in a modern network environment should embrace the principles of Zero Trust. The most practical implementation of which is <a href=\"https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_term=ztna&amp;utm_campaign=contributed_article_Mar23\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</b></a>.</p>\n<p>Zero Trust itself is a set of ideas about security based on the idea \"never trust, always verify.\" That is, no one should be allowed to just login to the network and stay as long as they like. Because if you do that, you can never really know whether or not the user logging in is who they claim to be, or if they're a threat actor who obtained a legitimate user's login credentials.</p>\n<p>Instead, each user should only be allowed to access resources they need to do their job, and not to every cloud resource or on-prem server in the company. An HR employee, for example, has no practical reason to access a company Git server containing a codebase, or an SQL database containing sensitive customer information. So the network should, by default, group HR employees together into one group and disallow them from accessing that information.</p>\n<p>This approach goes for every department. Only the resources they need to do their jobs should be available, while access to everything else is disallowed.</p>\n<p>Segmenting access at the application level isn't quite enough to qualify as Zero Trust, however. In fact, this level of restricting access, known as micro-segmentation, is just one part of the Zero Trust approach.</p>\n<p>A full ZTNA implementation also embraces context checks that can involve the security status of a managed device, time-based access rules, and geographic requirements. </p>\n<p>You might, for example, require that managed devices must be running a specific minimum version of Windows or macOS. You could require that all devices have a specific antivirus solution running, or that a specific security certificate is installed somewhere on the device. </p>\n<p>Micro-segmentation, allowing specific people to access specific applications, in conjunction with context-based authentication rules provides a complete Zero Trust approach.</p>\n<p>In addition, there should be access rules not only for users on managed devices, but also on unmanaged devices. The latter are best handled by Agentless ZTNA solutions where people access individual applications through a web portal that is not discoverable over the open Internet. Here, too, you can apply context rules such as allowing access only during certain times of day, or disallowing access based on location.</p>\n<p>With a ZTNA strategy in place, it will be much harder for threat actors to traverse a business network in search of sensitive data. Ransomware will have a much harder time encrypting all of a business' files, and disgruntled employees won't be able to exfiltrate as much data or cause other mayhem within the company.</p>\n<h2>Fight Malware and Protect the Network From the Cloud</h2>\n<p>All of these tools and technologies: ZTNA, Malware Protection, and <a href=\"https://www.perimeter81.com/web-filtering?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_term=secure_internet_access&amp;utm_campaign=contributed_article_Mar23\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Web Filtering</b></a> are best served as part of a cloud-based, converged network security solution like <b>Perimeter 81</b>. Being cloud-based means there's no hardware to maintain or upgrade, and scalability is much simpler. Plus, a converged solution means you can manage everything from a single dashboard for full visibility.</p>\n<p>With a converged security solution to help manage your network and network security you'll be off to a great start protecting your business.</p>\n Google tag (gtag.js) \n\n\n Event snippet for Hacker News Remarketing Mar23 remarketing page \n\n <noscript> <img alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=292682&amp;fmt=gif\" height=\"1\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" style=\"display:none;\" width=\"1\"/> </noscript>\n Twitter conversion tracking base code \n\n End Twitter conversion tracking base code \n<br/>\n\n\n"

And with the mass migration to remote working during the pandemic, hackers have ramped up their efforts to steal login credentials as they take advantage of the chaos and lack of in-person user verification. </p>\n<p>This has led to the revival of the old-school technique of vishing, which, like phishing online, involves using social engineering over the phone to steal sensitive information. Vishing attacks have <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/monitor/vishing-smishing-attacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">been on the rise</a> as a result, with 69% of companies experiencing them in 2021, up from 54% in 2020. These attacks often take the form of job or tech support scams and can be incredibly convincing. In August 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/social-engineering-it-service-desk/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FBI along with the CISA</a> issued a warning regarding remote users being targeted by attackers spoofing organizations' business numbers and impersonating the IT service desk.</p>\n<h2>Vishing bypassing 2FA</h2>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects of vishing is the attackers' ability to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) security measures. 2FA is a popular form of multi-factor authentication that requires users to provide two types of information: a password and a one-time code sent via SMS. </p>\n<p>Attackers achieve this by impersonating a support representative and requesting the victim's 2FA code over the phone. If the victim provides the code, the attacker can gain full access to their account, potentially leading to financial or personal information being compromised.</p>\n<h2>Attackers impersonating as help desk support </h2>\n<p>A common instance is when individuals receive a pop-up alert claiming that their device has been breached or infected with malware and that professional phone support is required to fix the problem. Alternatively, victims may receive a call from an alleged tech support representative from a reputable software provider, claiming that malware has been detected on their machine. The attacker will try to convince the user to download remote access software under the pretext of corporate IT help desk representatives. This is the final phase of the scam, after which it's checkmate for the unsuspecting victims and a potential payday for the attackers.</p>\n<p>Attackers impersonating the help desk is clearly working: in July 2020, <a href=\"https://www.tessian.com/blog/examples-of-social-engineering-attacks/#:~:text=High%2DProfile%20Twitters%20Users'%20Accounts,Joe%20Biden%2C%20and%20Kanye%20West.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> experienced a major security breach when hackers used a vishing scam to successfully access dozens of high-profile accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk. The attackers used these accounts to tweet a bitcoin scam, resulting in the swift theft of over $100,000. Unlike traditional scams, these attacks target carefully selected individuals by gathering extensive information about them from social media and other public sources. This information is then used to identify employees who are most likely to cooperate and have access to the desired resources, at which point attackers are primed and ready to wreak havoc.</p>\n<h2>A twist as attackers call the help desk &amp; impersonate end-users </h2>\n<p>Social engineering attacks are carefully fabricated with collected data and can be used to impersonate an end-user on a call to the help desk. An experienced attacker can easily acquire answers to security questions from various sources, especially knowing end-users put too much personal information on social media and the web.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft said that LAPSUS$</a>, a known threat group, calls on a targeted organization's help desk and attempts to convince support personnel to reset a privileged account's credentials. The group would use previously gathered information, have an English-speaking caller speak with the help desk. They would be able to answer common recovery prompts such as \"first street you lived on\" or \"mother's maiden name\" from data collected to convince help desk personnel of authenticity. </p>\n<p>In another attempt to reach the help desk, slack was used. <a href=\"https://therecord.media/hackers-leak-full-ea-data-after-failed-extortion-attempt/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Arts</a> had 780GB of source code downloaded by hackers presumed to also be <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LAPSUS$</a>. The threat actors used the authentication cookies to impersonate an already-logged-in employee's account and access EA's Slack channel, then convinced an IT support employee into granting them access to the company's internal network.</p>\n<h2>How can your Help Desk know who's <em>really</em> calling</h2>\n<p>Verifying user identity in the vishing age is more important than ever. With the rise of cyber-attacks and social engineering, it's crucial for organizations to have security measures in place to safeguard their employees, protect their sensitive information, and prevent unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>One effective way to safeguard against these types of attacks is to implement a <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/secure-service-desk/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2023_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">secure service desk solution</a>, which allows for the verification of user accounts with existing data beyond just knowledge-based authentication. This can be achieved by sending a one-time code to the mobile number associated with the user's account or using existing authentication services to verify callers.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcing user authentication is another key aspect of <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/secure-service-desk/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2023_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specops Secure Service Desk</a>. This ensures that information and password resets are only offered to authorized users, which is essential for protecting high-security accounts and adhering to regulatory requirements. With a Secure Service Desk, you can remove the opportunity for user impersonation by requiring verification with something the user has and not just relying on something the user \u2013 or an attacker \u2013 may know.</p>\n<p>In addition to verifying and enforcing user authentication, a secure service desk also allows for the secure reset or unlocking of user accounts. This is done only after the user has been successfully verified and can be combined with a self-service password reset tool to assist with account unlocks and the password reset process.</p>\n<p>With vishing scams showing no signs of slowing down, investing in Specops Secure Service Desk solution could be a critical step for organizations looking to protect their people from even the subtlest of social engineering attempts. By instilling a comprehensive and effective way to verify user identity, enforce user authentication, and reset or unlock user accounts, would-be victims can rest assured that they'll always <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/secure-service-desk/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2023_thehackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">know who's really calling</a>.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>At the beginning of January, Gcore faced an incident involving several L3/L4 DDoS attacks with a peak volume of 650 Gbps. Attackers exploited over 2000 servers belonging to one of the top three cloud providers worldwide and targeted a client who was using a free CDN plan. However, due to Gcore's distribution of infrastructure and a large number of peering partners, the attacks were mitigated, and the client's web application remained available.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Why was mitigating these attacks so significant?</strong></h2>\n<p><b>1. These attacks were significant because they exceeded the average bandwidth of similar attacks by 60\u00d7.</b> The performed attacks relate to volume-based attacks targeted to saturate the attacked application's bandwidth in order to overflow it. Measuring total volume (bps)\u2014rather than the number of requests\u2014is the way these attacks are usually tabulated.</p>\n<p>The average bandwidth of this attack type is generally in the tens of Gbps (about 10 Gbps). Therefore, the specified attacks (at 650 Gbps) exceeded the average value by 60 times. Attacks of this volume are rare and are of particular interest to security experts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this value (650 Gbps) is comparable to the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/mirai-botnet-hits-wynncraft-minecraft.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">record DDoS attack on the largest Minecraft server</a> (2.4 Tbps), only one-fourth as massive.</p>\n<p><b>2. The client being attacked was using a CDN plan without additional <a href=\"https://gcore.com/ddos-protection?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=gcore_ddos_security_thehackernews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS protection</a>. </b>When clients use Gcore's CDN (as part of the Edge Network), the malicious traffic of the L3/L4 attacks directly affects only its infrastructure (it serves as a filter), not the targeted clients' servers. The negative impact falls on the capacity and connectivity of the infrastructure When a CDN is powerful enough, it can protect clients against L3/L4 attacks\u2014even when accessed using a free plan.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What were the technical specifications of the attacks?</strong></h2>\n<p>The duration of the incident was 15 minutes, and at its peak, it reached over 650 Gbps. A possible reason why the incident took so long is that the attackers weighed the ineffectiveness of the attacks (the client application kept running) against their high cost.</p>\n<p>The incident consisted of three attacks with different vectors. They are marked with traffic peaks on the diagram below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>UDP flood attack (~650 Gbps).</strong> Hundreds of millions of UDP packets were sent to the target server to consume the bandwidth of the application and cause its unavailability. Attacks of this vector use a lack of requirements of UDP connection establishment: the attackers can send packets with any data (it increases the volume) and use spoofed IP addresses (it makes it difficult to find the sender).</li>\n<li><strong>TCP ACK flood attack (~600 Gbps).</strong> A large number of packets with the ACK flag were sent to the target server to overflow it. Attacks of this vector are based on the fact that the junk TCP packets do not include a payload, but the server is forced to process them, and it may not have enough resources to handle requests from real end users. A CDN's protection system is capable of filtering packets and not forwarding them to the server if they do not contain payloads and are not bound to an open TCP session.</li>\n<li><strong>A mix of TCP and UDP (~600 Gbps).</strong> A custom variation of the previous two types of attacks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The distinctiveness of the incident was that the attacks were performed from multiple non-spoofed IP addresses. This allowed specialists to identify that the attackers used 2,143 servers in 44 different regions, and all of the servers belonged to a single public cloud provider. Utilizing Anycast allowed Gcore to absorb the attack 100% over peering connections with this provider.</p>\n\n<p>Sankey diagram showing the source and flow of the attack. Names of the locations from the first column are associated with one of the top 3 cloud providers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Why did the attacks not affect the client?</strong></h2>\n<p><b>1. Gcore's connectivity through peering with many locations played a key role in mitigating the attacks.</b> Gcore has over 11,000 peering partners (ISPs), and these partners connect their networks using cables and provide each other with access to traffic originating from their networks. These connections allow for bypassing the public internet and directly absorbing traffic from the peering partners. Additionally, this traffic is either free of charge or costs much less than traffic on the public internet. This low cost makes it possible to protect customer traffic on a free plan.</p>\n<p>In the context of the DDoS attack that occurred, the level of connectivity greatly benefited the efficacy of mitigation. Gcore and the cloud provider used to launch the attack are peering partners, so while the attack was happening, Gcore was able to ingest most of the traffic over the cloud provider's private network. This greatly reduced the amount of traffic that needed to be handled by the public internet.</p>\n<p>Private peering also enables more accurate filtering and better attack visibility, which leads to more efficient attack mitigation.</p>\n<p><b>2. Gcore's large capacity, due to the placement of servers in many data centers, also played a role.</b> Gcore's edge servers are present in over 140 points of presence and are based on high-performance 3rd generation Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors.</p>\n<p>The overall network capacity is over 110 Tbps. With over 500 servers located in data centers worldwide, the company is able to withstand large-scale DDoS attacks. So, the 650 Gbps of traffic could be distributed across the network, and each particular server would only receive 1-2 Gbps, which is an insignificant load.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Security trends</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://gcore.com/blog/ddos-attack-trends-in-q1q2-of-2022/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gcore's experience</a>, DDoS attacks will continue to grow year over year. In 2021, the attacks reached 300 Gbps, and by 2022, they had increased to 700 Gbps. Therefore, even small and medium-sized businesses need to use distributed content delivery networks such as the CDN and Cloud to protect against DDoS attacks.</p>\n\n<noscript><img alt=\"The Hacker News\" data-src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1274162579887490&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1\" height=\"1\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" style=\"display:none\" width=\"1\"/></noscript>\n\n\n\n<noscript>\n<img alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=5108937&amp;fmt=gif\" height=\"1\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" style=\"display:none;\" width=\"1\"/>\n</noscript>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

If not, it's time to do so, as the tech giant just released security updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari. The update is to fix a zero-day vulnerability that hackers have been exploiting.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-23529, is related to a type confusion bug in the WebKit browser engine. What does this mean? Well, it means that if you visit a website with malicious code, the bug can be activated, leading to arbitrary code execution. In other words, hackers can take control of your device and access all your data.</p>\n<p>It's scary to think that simply visiting a website could lead to a security breach. This is why it's essential to keep your devices updated with the latest security patches.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/esxiargs-ransomware-hits-over-500-new.html\">Don't Be the Next Victim: ESXiArgs Ransomware \ud83d\udca5 Strikes 500+ New European Targets</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Another expertly-crafted comprehensive coverage by Ravie Lakshmanan.</p><p>In a recent discovery by cybersecurity firm Censys, more than 500 hosts have fallen victim to the ESXiArgs ransomware strain. Most of these compromised hosts are located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Ukraine. What's particularly concerning is that Censys found two hosts with ransom notes dating back to mid-October 2022, shortly after ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 reached their end of life.</p>\n<p>This means that the attackers behind ESXiArgs have been active for several months, and were able to gain a foothold in these hosts during a time when they were no longer receiving security updates or patches. It also shows that ransomware attacks can take a while to gain traction, and can often go undetected for months before they are discovered.</p>\n\n<p>What's even more alarming is that the ransom notes on the two hosts were updated on January 31, 2023, with a revised version that matches the ones used in the current wave of attacks. This suggests that the attackers have been refining their tactics and improving their ransomware strain to make it more effective.</p>\n<p>Ransomware attacks like ESXiArgs can be devastating for organizations, causing data loss, financial losses, and reputational damage. It's important for organizations to stay vigilant and ensure that their systems are always up to date with the latest security patches and updates. </p>\n<p>Additionally, having a solid backup and disaster recovery plan can help organizations quickly recover from an attack and minimize its impact.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/massive-http-ddos-attack-hits-record.html\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS Attack Breaks Record - 71 Million \ud83d\ude2e Requests Per Second!</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has reported that they have successfully stopped a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. This attack, which peaked at over 71 million requests per second, is the largest HTTP DDoS attack that has been recorded so far, breaking the previous record of 46 million requests per second.</p>\n<p>The attack was so large that Cloudflare has dubbed it a \"hyper-volumetric\" DDoS attack. The attack was targeted at websites that were secured by Cloudflare's platform, and it is believed that the attack originated from a botnet that was made up of more than 30,000 IP addresses from various cloud providers.</p>\n<p>This attack is a reminder that DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to websites and online services, and it is crucial for companies to have robust security measures in place to protect against such attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><br/></strong></h3><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4. <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/update-now-microsoft-releases-patches.html\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Releases Urgent Patches - Update Your Windows ASAP!</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Microsoft has been busy this week, releasing security updates to fix a whopping 75 vulnerabilities in its products. That's a lot of potential ways for cybercriminals to wreak havoc on our devices and systems!</p>\n<p>Three of the flaws have already been exploited in the wild, so it's crucial that users update their software as soon as possible. In total, nine of the vulnerabilities are rated as Critical, which means they could allow attackers to take over a device remotely.</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more! 37 of the flaws are what are known as remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. These are particularly dangerous because they allow attackers to execute code on a victim's device without any interaction or permission.</p>\n<p>So, if you're using any Microsoft products, it's best to update them as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>5. <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/new-mirai-botnet-variant-v3g4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Linux \ud83d\udc27 and IoT Devices Under Attack by V3G4 Mirai Botnet</a></strong></h3>\n<p>A new variant of the infamous Mirai botnet has been spotted wreaking havoc in the world of Linux and IoT devices. This new version, dubbed V3G4 by the experts at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, is making use of 13 security vulnerabilities to spread itself far and wide.</p>\n<p>As we know, the Mirai botnet has a notorious history, having been responsible for several high-profile attacks in the past. This new variant only serves to underscore the importance of keeping our devices and systems up to date with the latest security patches and measures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>6. <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/hackers-using-google-ads-to-spread.html\" target=\"_blank\">Your Favorite Apps Could be Carrying a Dangerous Virus - \ud83d\udea8 Stay Alert!</a></strong></h3>\n<p>Cybercriminals have launched a new type of attack targeting Chinese-speaking individuals in Southeast and East Asia. Using rogue Google Ads, they are tricking people looking for popular applications like Google Chrome, WhatsApp, and Skype and directing them to fake websites that download malware onto their machines.</p>\n<p>The attacks are particularly insidious because they use seemingly legitimate Google Ads to lure in victims. The malware being downloaded is a remote access trojan called FatalRAT, which gives the attackers complete control over the infected machine.</p>\n<p>Security researchers are urging people to be cautious when downloading applications, especially from unfamiliar websites.</p>\n\n<p>Well folks, that's all for this week's cybersecurity newsletter.</p>\n<p>As always, remember that cybersecurity is not just a one-time event or a quick fix. Whether it's using strong passwords, regularly updating your software, or staying aware of phishing scams, every small action can make a big difference in safeguarding your online security.<br/>So keep those firewalls up, keep those updates coming, and let's continue to stay curious, stay vigilant, and stay safe in the ever-changing digital landscape.</p>\n<p>And above all, remember that cybersecurity is a community effort.

        "contents": "\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Ransomware: contemporary threats, how to prevent them and how the FBI can help</em></h4>\n<p>In April 2021, Dutch supermarkets faced a food shortage. The cause wasn't a drought or a sudden surge in the demand for avocados. Rather, the reason was a ransomware attack. In the past years, companies, universities, schools, medical facilities and other organizations have been targeted by ransomware threat actors, turning ransomware into the internet's most severe security crisis.</p>\n<h2>The Ransomware Landscape</h2>\n<p>Ransomware has existed for more than 30 years, but it became a lucrative source of income for cyber actors and gangs in the past decade. Since 2015, ransomware gangs have been targeting organizations instead of individuals. Consequently, ransom sums have increased significantly, reaching millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Ransomware is effective because it pressures victims in two, complementary ways. First, by threatening victims to destroy their data. Second, by threatening to publicize the attack. The second threat has an indirect impact, yet it is just as serious (if not more). Publication could trigger regulatory and compliance issues, as well as negative long-term brand effects.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of real ransomware notes:</p>\n\n<p>Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) has become the most widespread type of ransomware. In RaaS attacks, the ransomware infrastructure is developed by cyber criminals and then licensed out to other attackers for their use. The customer attackers can pay for the use of software or they can split the loot with the creators. Etay maor, Senior Director Security Strategy at <a href=\"https://www.catonetworks.com?utm_source=hn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Cato Networks</b></a> commented, \"There are other forms of RaaS. After receiving the ransomware payment some Ransomware groups sell all the data about the victim's network to other gangs. This means the next attack is much simpler and can be fully automated as it does not require weeks of discovery and network analysis by the attackers.\" </p>\n<p>Some of the major RaaS players, who are notorious for turning the RaaS landscape into what it is today, are CryptoLocker, who infected over a quarter million systems in the 2000s and profited more than $3 million in less than four months, CryptoWall, who made over $18 million and prompted an FBI advisory, and finally Petya, NotPetya and WannaCry who used various types of exploits, ransomware included.</p>\n<h2>How the FBI Helps Combat Ransomware</h2>\n<p>An organization under attack is bound to experience frustration and confusion. One of the first recommended courses of action is to contact an Incident Response team. The IR team can assist with investigation, recuperation and negotiations. Then, the FBI can also help.</p>\n<p>Part of the FBI's mission is to raise awareness about ransomware. Thanks to a wide local and global network, they have access to valuable intelligence. This information can help victims with negotiations and with operationalization. For example, the FBI might be able to provide profiler information about a threat actor based on its Bitcoin wallet.</p>\n<p>To help ransomware victims and to prevent ransomware, the FBI has set up 56 Cyber Task Forces across its field offices. These Task Forces work closely with the IRS, the Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Protective Service and the State Police. They're also in close contact with the Secret Service and have access to regional forensics labs. For National Security cyber crimes, the FBI has a designated Squad.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Cyber Task Force, the FBI operates a 24/7 CyWatch, which is a Watch Center for coordinating the field offices, the private sector and other federal and intelligence agencies. There is also an Internet Crime Complaint Center, ic3.gov, for registering complaints and identifying trends.</p>\n<h2>Preventing Ransomware Attacks On Time</h2>\n<p>Many ransomware attacks don't have to reach the point where the FBI is needed. Rather, they can be avoided beforehand. Ransomware is not a single-shot attack. Instead, a series of tactics and techniques all contribute to its execution. By identifying the network and security vulnerabilities in advance that enables the attack, organizations can block or limit threat actors' ability to perform ransomware. Etay Maor added \"We need to rethink the concept that \"the attackers need to be right just once, the defenders need to be right all the time\". A cyber attack is a combination of multiple tactics and techniques. As such, it can only be countered with a holistic approach, with multiple converged security systems that all share context in real time. This is exactly what a <a href=\"https://www.catonetworks.com/sase?utm_source=hn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>SASE architecture</b></a>, and no other, offers the defenders\". </p>\n<p>For example, here are all the steps in a REvil attack on a well-known manufacturer, mapped out to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. As you can see, there are numerous phases that took place before the actual ransom and were essential to its \"success\". By mitigating those risks, the attack might have been prevented.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a similar mapping of a Sodinokobi attack:</p>\n\n<p>Maze attack mapping to the MITRE framework:</p>\n\n<p>Another way to map ransomware attacks is through heat maps, which show how often different tactics and techniques are used. Here is a heat map of Maze attacks:</p>\n\n<p>One way to use these mappings is for network analysis and systems testing. By testing a system's resilience to these tactics and techniques and implementing controls that can mitigate any risks, organizations reduce the risk of a ransomware attack by a certain actor on their critical resources.</p>\n<h2>How to Avoid Attacks - From the Horse's Mouth</h2>\n<p>But don't take our word for it. Some ransomware attackers are \"kind\" enough to provide organizations with best practices for securing themselves from future ransomware attacks. Recommendations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning off local passwords</li>\n<li>Using secure passwords</li>\n<li>Forcing the end of admin sessions</li>\n<li>Configuring group policies</li>\n<li>Checking privileged users' access</li>\n<li>Ensuring only necessary applications are running</li>\n<li>Limiting the reliance of Anti-Virus</li>\n<li>Installing EDRs</li>\n<li>24 hour system admins</li>\n<li>Securing vulnerable ports</li>\n<li>Watching for misconfigured firewalls</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Etay Maor of Cato Networks highlights \"Nothing in what several Ransomware groups say organizations need to do is new. These best practices have been discussed for years. The reason they still work is that we try to apply them using disjoint, point solutions. That didn't work and will not work. A SASE, cloud native, architecture, where all security solutions share context and have the capability to see every networks flow and get a holistic view of the attack lifecycle can level the playing field against cyber attacks\".</p>\n\n<h2>Ransomware Prevention: An Ongoing Activity</h2>\n<p>Just like brushing your teeth or exercising, security hygiene is an ongoing, methodical practice. Ransomware attackers have been known to revisit the crime scene and demand a second ransom, if issues haven't been resolved. By employing security controls that can effectively mitigate security threats and having a proper incident response plan in place, the risks can be minimized, as well as the attackers' pay day. The FBI is here to help and provide information that can assist, let's hope that assistance won't be needed.</p>\n<p>To learn more about ransomware attacks and how to prevent them, <a href=\"https://catonetworks.easywebinar.live/registration-73?utm_source=hn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Cato Networks' Cyber Security Masterclass series is available for your viewing.</b></a></p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Cybercriminals continue to take advantage of the prevalence of digital devices and the internet to perpetrate their crimes. As the internet of things continues to develop, cybercriminals will have access to a greater number of vulnerable devices, allowing them to carry out more sophisticated attacks. Cybercrime is expected to become increasingly profitable as criminals continue to find new and better ways to monetize their attack as entry barriers to cybercrime keep going down. </p>\n<p>This article discusses key trends we've noticed in 2022 that will likely continue in 2023, which we'll also elaborate on in the upcoming webinar \"<a href=\"https://go.cynet.com/webinar_2023predictions?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Rise of the Rookie Hacker - a new trend to reckon with</a>\" on January 11th.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Leaked credentials will continue to be the main attack vector for initial access</strong></h2>\n<p>According to IBM's cost of a breach 2022 report, use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most common cause of a data breach. </p>\n<p>The main source for leaked credentials in 2022 was Info-Stealers - a malware that can steal stored credentials from browsers, cookies (used for session hijacking and to bypass MFA), crypto wallets, and more. Redline Stealer, in particular, gained a lot of popularity among threat actors which led to the creation of several other stealers such as the \"Luca stealer\" and the \"eternity stealer\". The latter is part of an end-to-end offering named <a href=\"https://www.cynet.com/blog/cyops-lighthouse-eternity-project/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the eternity project</a>, which allows threat actors to buy or rent any tool they need to launch an attack against a target of their choosing.</p>\n<p>Stolen or compromised credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study. This trend is most likely to keep in its upward trajectory as a whopping 59% of organizations don't deploy zero-trust, incurring an average of 1 million USD in greater breach costs compared to those that do deploy. Until organizations' cybersecurity will mature, the volume and cost of breaches will continue to rise.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A rise in zero-knowledge attacks</strong></h2>\n<p>Cybercrimes such as DDoS, malware, and ransomware are all offered as subscription services, lowering the entry barrier into cybercrime. For example, per the Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2022, phishing kits are offered on the dark web from as little as $6 and DDoS attack subscriptions for as little as $500. <a href=\"https://www.cynet.com/blog/cyops-lighthouse-a-peek-into-the-darknet/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ransomware-as-a-Service</a> offered as an affiliates model is the preferred method by actors, this means \"renting\" an already made operation and splitting the revenue based on income and activity. The rise of <a href=\"https://www.cynet.com/blog/cyops-lighthouse-a-peek-into-the-darknet-maas/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"clearnet malware\"</a> - malware that can be purchased on everyday platforms like Telegram (Hello again eternity project!) helps simplify setting up a cybercrime campaign or operation. The proliferation of crypto payment platforms makes it even easier to trade in cybercrime products and services, pushing the entire cybercrime ecosystem even further. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Younger threat actors - average age will continue to drop</strong></h2>\n<p>In terms of cyberattacks, 2022 was Gen Z's time to shine, leading with UK teen group Lapsus$ that went on a hacking spree targeting tech titans like Microsoft, Nvidia, Samsung, Ubisoft, and Okta. Generation Z is currently the largest generation on earth. Besides their strength in numbers, they are \"digital natives\", being born into a world with the internet, smartphones, cloud technologies, and social networks. Being young, they naturally crave social validation which they get in the digital sphere. Lapsus$'s main motivator was \"Kudos\" - they were \"doing it for the lulz\". The ease of launching zero-knowledge attacks, combined with Gen Z's digital nativeness and their need for social validation in the digital sphere will most likely contribute to the continuous drop in the average age of cyber criminals.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>We'll still need humans in the loop</strong></h2>\n<p>Enterprises invest billions of dollars deploying multi-layered security frameworks, platforms, and programs, but at the end of the day, enterprises are made of people, and people can be tricked.</p>\n<p>Social engineering is an increasingly popular tactic used by cyberattackers to gain access to sensitive data. It involves exploiting human psychology to manipulate victims into providing confidential information or taking certain actions in order to gain access to a system or network. </p>\n<p>LAPSUS$'s modus operandi was based on a text-book sim swapping scam. They bought credentials of the person with the right access to resources within an enterprise, called the phone provider, reporting the phone stolen, rerouted the sim to their own phone, triggered multi factor authentication on an enterprise access point (e.g. Office365 login page), and did a password reset. It was ridiculously simple and devastatingly efficient.</p>\n<p>The best technology in the world can't completely remove the risk of human vulnerability. For that you need other humans trained in that. The cybersecurity workforce gap compelled enterprises to outsource this part of their cybersecurity to a managed detection and response (MDR) service. In fact, (according to Reportlinker.com) the global MDR market size is expected to grow from an estimated value of 2.6 billion USD in 2022 to 5.6 billion USD by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.0%. Technology is great, machines are great, but we still need humans.</p>\n<p>Join Ronen Ahdut, Head of Cyber Threat Intelligence at Cynet for a webinar \"<a href=\"https://go.cynet.com/webinar_2023predictions?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Rise of the Rookie Hacker - a new trend to reckon with</a>\" on January 11th at 10AM ET / 15:00 GMT.

        "contents": "\n<p>Threat actors continue to adapt to the latest technologies, practices, and even data privacy laws\u2014and it's up to organizations to stay one step ahead by implementing strong cybersecurity measures and programs. </p>\n<p>Here's a look at how cybercrime will evolve in 2023 and what you can do to secure and protect your organization in the year ahead. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Increase in digital supply chain attacks </h2>\n<p>With the rapid modernization and digitization of supply chains come new security risks. Gartner predicts that <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/7-top-trends-in-cybersecurity-for-2022\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by 2025, 45% of organizations worldwide will have experienced attacks</a> on their software supply chains\u2014this is a three-fold increase from 2021. Previously, these types of attacks weren't even likely to happen because supply chains weren't connected to the internet. But now that they are, supply chains need to be secured properly. </p>\n<p>The introduction of new technology around software supply chains means there are likely security holes that have yet to be identified, but are essential to uncover in order to protect your organization in 2023. </p>\n<p>If you've introduced <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-is-the-digital-supply-chain\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new software supply chains to your technology stack</a>, or plan to do so sometime in the next year, then you must integrate updated cybersecurity configurations. Employ people and processes that have experience with digital supply chains to ensure that security measures are implemented correctly. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Mobile-specific cyber threats are on-the-rise</h2>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that with the increased use of smartphones in the workplace, mobile devices are becoming a greater target for cyber-attack. In fact, cyber-crimes involving mobile devices have increased by 22% in the last year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-mobile-security-index-remote-work-cybercrime\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon Mobile Security Index (MSI) 2022</a> with no signs of slowing down in advance of the new year. </p>\n<p>As hackers hone in on mobile devices, SMS-based authentication has inevitably become less secure. Even the seemingly most secure companies can be vulnerable to mobile device hacks. Case in point, several major companies, including <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/uber-says-its-investigating-potential.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/okta-says-security-breach-by-lapsus.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Okta</a> were impacted by security breaches involving one-time passcodes in the past year alone. </p>\n<p>This calls for the need to move away from relying on SMS-based authentication, and instead to multifactor authentication (MFA) that is more secure. This could include an authenticator app that uses time-sensitive tokens, or more direct authenticators that are hardware or device-based. </p>\n<p>Organizations need to take extra precautions to prevent attacks that begin with the frontline by implementing software that helps verify user identity. According to the World Economic Forum's <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2022 Global Risks Report</a>, 95% of cybersecurity incidents are due to human error. This fact alone emphasizes the need for a software procedure that decreases the chance of human error when it comes to verification. Implementing a tool like <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/secure-service-desk/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2022_hackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specops' Secure Service Desk</a> helps reduce vulnerabilities from socially engineered attacks that are targeting the help desk, enabling a secure user verification at the service desk without the risk of human error.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Double down on cloud security </h2>\n<p>As more companies opt for cloud-based activities, cloud security\u2014any technology, policy, or service that protects information stored in the cloud\u2014should be a top priority in 2023 and beyond. Cyber criminals become more sophisticated and evolve their tactics as technologies evolve, which means cloud security is essential as you rely on it more frequently in your organization. </p>\n<p>The most reliable <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/blog/zero-trust-model-save-your-org-from-cyber-attack/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2022_hackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">safeguard against cloud-based cybercrime is a zero trust philosophy.</a> The main principle behind zero trust is to automatically verify everything\u2014and essentially not trust anyone without some type of authorization or inspection. This security measure is critical when it comes to protecting data and infrastructure stored in the cloud from threats. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Ransomware-as-a-Service is here to stay </h2>\n<p>Ransomware attacks continue to increase at an alarming rate. Data from Verizon discovered a <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/ransomware-threat-rises-verizon-2022-data-breach-investigations-report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">13% increase in ransomware breaches</a> year-over-year. Ransomware attacks have also become increasingly targeted \u2014 sectors such as <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/official-alerts-statements-fbi\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">healthcare and food and agriculture</a> are just the latest industries to be victims, according to the FBI.</p>\n<p>With the rise in ransomware threats comes the increased use of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). This <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">growing phenomenon is when ransomware criminals lease out their infrastructure</a> to other cybercriminals or groups. RaaS kits make it even easier for threat actors to deploy their attacks quickly and affordably, which is a dangerous combination to combat for anyone leading the cybersecurity protocols and procedures. To increase protection against threat actors who use RaaS, enlist the help of your end-users. </p>\n<p>End-users are your organization's frontline against ransomware attacks, but they need the proper training to ensure they're protected. Make sure your cybersecurity procedures are clearly documented and regularly practiced so users can stay aware and vigilant against security breaches. Employing backup measures like <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-policy/?utm_source=thehackernews.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=na_2022_hackernews&amp;utm_content=guest-post\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">password policy software</a>, MFA whenever possible, and <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/email-security\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">email-security tools</a> in your organization can also mitigate the onus on end-user cybersecurity. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Data privacy laws are getting stricter\u2014get ready </h2>\n<p>We can't talk about cybersecurity in 2023 without mentioning data privacy laws. With new data privacy laws set to <a href=\"https://www.cbia.com/news/issues-policies/privacy-security-compliance/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">go into effect in several states</a> over the next year, now is the time to assess your current procedures and systems to make sure they comply. These new state-specific laws are just the beginning; companies would be wise to review their compliance as more states are likely to develop new privacy laws in the years to come. </p>\n<p>Data privacy laws often require changes to how companies store and processing data, and implementing these new changes might open you up to additional risk if they are not implemented carefully. Ensure your organization is in adherence to proper cyber security protocols, including zero trust, as mentioned above.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Underlying it is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network which replicates content across all participating nodes so that even if a file is removed from one machine, requests for the resource can still be served via other systems.</p>\n\n<p>This also makes it ripe for abuse by bad actors looking to host malware that can resist law enforcement attempts at disrupting their attack infrastructure, like seen in the case of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/european-authorities-disrupt-emotet.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Emotet</a> last year.</p>\n<p>\"IPFS is currently being abused by a variety of threat actors who are using it to host malicious contents as part of phishing and malware distribution campaigns,\" Brumaghin previously <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/a-growing-number-of-malware-attacks.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> The Hacker News in August 2022.</p>\n<p>This includes <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/a-growing-number-of-malware-attacks.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Utilities</a>, a command-and-control (C2) framework that's advertised as a way for adversaries to avail remote system access, DDoS capabilities, and cryptocurrency mining, with the payload binaries provided by the platform hosted in IPFS.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, IPFS has been put to use to serve rogue landing pages as part of phishing campaigns orchestrated to steal credentials and distribute a wide range of malware comprising <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/researchers-detail-originlogger-rat.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Agent Tesla</a>, reverse shells, data wiper, and an information stealer called Hannabi Grabber.</p>\n<p>In one malspam delivery chain detailed by Talos, an email purporting to be from a Turkish financial institution urged the recipient to open a ZIP file attachment that, when launched, worked as a downloader to retrieve an obfuscated version of Agent Tesla hosted within the IPFS network.</p>\n\n<p>The destructive malware, for its part, takes the form of a batch file that deletes backups and recursively purges all directory contents. Hannabi Grabber is a Python-based malware that gathers sensitive information from the infected host, such as browser data and screenshots, and transmits it via a <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Discord Webhook</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest development points to the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/over-dozen-malicious-npm-packages.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">growing use</a> by <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/virustotal-reveals-most-impersonated.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attackers</a> of legitimate offerings such as Discord, Slack, Telegram, Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS, and several others to host malicious content or to direct users to it, making phishing one of the lucrative primary initial access vectors.</p>\n<p>\"We expect this activity to continue to increase as more threat actors recognize that IPFS can be used to facilitate bulletproof hosting, is resilient against content moderation and law enforcement activities, and introduces problems for organizations attempting to detect and defend against attacks that may leverage the IPFS network,\" Brumaghin said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>Ransomware is the de facto threat organizations have faced over the past few years. Threat actors were making easy money by exploiting the high valuation of cryptocurrencies and their victims' lack of adequate preparation. </p>\n<p>Think about bad security policies, untested backups, patch management practices not up-to-par, and so forth. It resulted in easy growth for ransomware extortion, a crime that multiple threat actors around the world perpetrate. </p>\n<p>Something's changed, though. Crypto valuations have dropped, reducing the monetary appeal of ransomware attacks due to organizations mounting a formidable defense against ransomware.</p>\n<p>Threat actors have been searching for another opportunity \u2013 and found one. It's called data exfiltration, or exfil, a type of espionage causing headaches at organizations worldwide. Let's take a look.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The threat to reveal confidential information</h2>\n<p>Information exfiltration is rapidly becoming more prevalent. Earlier this year, incidents at Nvidia, Microsoft, and several other companies have highlighted how big of a problem it's become \u2013 and how, for some organizations, it may be a threat that's even bigger than ransomware.</p>\n<p>Nvidia, for example, became entangled in a complex tit-for-tat exchange with hacker group Lapsus$. One of the biggest chipmakers in the world was faced with the public exposure of the source code for invaluable technology, as Lapsus$ leaked the source code for the company's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) research.</p>\n<p>When it comes to exfil extortion, attackers do not enter with the primary aim of encrypting a system and causing disruption the way that a ransomware attacker does. Though, yes, attackers may still use encryption to cover their tracks. </p>\n<p>Instead, attackers on an information exfiltration mission will move vast amounts of proprietary data to systems that they control. And here's the game: attackers will proceed to extort the victim, threatening to release that confidential information into the wild or to sell it to unscrupulous third parties.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Exfil can be far more damaging than ransomware</h2>\n<p>For victims, it's a serious threat because threat actors can acquire the keys to the safe. Competitors can use trade secrets to produce copies of products or aid in their R&amp;D efforts or information that could lead to a costly public relations disaster. </p>\n<p>Either way \u2013 public exposure of information can be a threat greater than ransomware because ransomware demand can be resolved by paying up (or by retrieving backups). Leaked information \u2013 well \u2013 that's something that may be unfixable. It's easy to see why threat actors can find extortion based on information leakage to be an even more attractive target than mere ransomware.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that part of the drive for this type of attack also lies in the current state of world affairs which have created a strong demand for intellectual property transfer across opposing geopolitical lines. There's also arguably greater leniency against actors attacking \"the other side,\" even when local judicial systems consider the attack a crime.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">In for the long haul</h2>\n<p>There's another theme that's emerging in the exfil space. It's interesting to note something that cybersecurity teams have known for a long time: for malicious actors, it's beneficial for an attacker to stay undetected for an extended period of time. </p>\n<p>Staying quietly, rather than flashing \"you've been hacked\" messages on computer screens, allows attackers to \"see\" more information flows in the network and to do more in-depth reconnaissance of systems after gaining entry. </p>\n<p>More time in the network means attackers can identify more desirable targets than just a simple ransomware deployment. Patient threat actors could do far more harm; if they remain undetected.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Protective measures still work</h2>\n<p>What can organizations do to guard against extortion? Well, the same cybersecurity principles continue to count, even more so given the greater risk.</p>\n<p>After so many years of alarming headlines, most organizations have deployed ransomware protection in the form of better backup strategies, more fine-tuned and granular data access, and better rules and monitoring for detecting unwanted file changes. </p>\n<p>It's made ransomware attacks harder, often acting as a deterrent against attackers simply looking for easy targets. Protecting against malware infections or information exfiltration starts with properly maintaining infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Seamless patching remains at the core</h2>\n<p>That includes keeping systems up to date with the latest patches. It's not just a guard against ransomware, of course: patched systems also close the easy paths to critical business information so that threat actors are not in a position to siphon off critical business information.</p>\n<p>Suppose your organization is still relying on patching operations that involve maintenance windows. In that case, it's worth considering whether patching is happening fast enough to protect your organization against information exfiltration threats. </p>\n<p>Can't patch fast enough? Take a look at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3CoMCiX\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">live patching</a>. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3CpkqfQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TuxCare's KernelCare Enterprise</a> helps you stay protected against emerging threats immediately, with little lag between threat emergence and mitigation.

Borat RAT malware goes beyond the standard features and enables threat actors to deploy ransomware and <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/does-your-ddos-protection-solution-defend-against-the-latest-attacks/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-borat-rat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DDoS attacks</strong></a>. It also increases the number of threat actors who can launch attacks, sometimes appealing to the lowest common denominator. The added functionality of carrying out DDoS attacks makes it insidious and a risk to today's digital organizations.</p>\n<p>Ransomware has been the most common top attack type for over <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ADLMYLAZ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three years</a>. According to an IBM report, REvil was the most common ransomware strain, consisting of about <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ADLMYLAZ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">37%</a> of all ransomware attacks. Borat RAT is a unique and powerful combination of RAT, spyware, and ransomware capabilities fused into a single malware. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Borat RAT: What Makes It a Triple Threat?</h2>\n<p>The Borat RAT provides a dashboard for malicious hackers to perform RAT malware activities and the ability to compile the malware binary for DDoS and <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/ransomware-prevention-why-web-security-is-important/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-borat-rat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ransomware attacks</strong></a> on the victim's machine. The RAT also includes code to launch a DDoS attack, slows down response services to legitimate users, and can even cause the site to go offline.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, Borat RAT can deliver a ransomware payload to the victim's machine to encrypt users' files and demand a ransom. The package also includes a keylogger executable file that monitors keystrokes on victims' computers and saves them in a .txt file for exfiltration. </p>\n<p>The other functionalities of Borat RAT malwarethat make it fun or not so fun including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reverse proxy to protect the hacker</li>\n<li>The ability to steal credentials from browsers or discord tokens</li>\n<li>Introduce malicious code into legitimate processes </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To annoy or scare its victims, the Borat RAT can also perform the following actions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switching off and on the monitor </li>\n<li>Hiding/showing the desktop features such as the start button and taskbar</li>\n<li>Playing unwanted audio </li>\n<li>Switching the webcam light on/off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Borat RAT malwarewill check to see if the system has a connected microphone and if so, will record audio from the computer, which will be saved in another file called \"micaudio.wav.\" Similarly, the malware can begin recording from the camera if a webcam is discovered on the system. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Should Businesses Develop a Solid Response Strategy?</h2>\n<p>The volatile landscape set by the pandemic has led to every industry being a potential target for pre-packaged malware sets like Borat. All it takes is an unsuspecting employee to accidentally click a malicious link or attachment to give full access to your organization's systems. This can result in operations being halted until the ransom is paid. The halt in operations leads to huge financial and physical losses for the company.</p>\n<p>The remote desktop function, which is included in the Borat RAT malware, can wreak havoc on your business as it allows the threat actor to delete critical information/intellectual rights, grab the version of the operating system and the model of the machine and steal potential cookies/saved login credentials. So, companies need to keep an eye out for the threat and prepare themselves against such attacks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Recommendations for Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Let's look at the recommendations listed below to secure your networks against the risk of cyberattacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examine the use of remote administration tools for applications and systems on the industrial network. Remove any remote administration tools that aren't necessary for the industrial process</li>\n<li>Establish strong password management and enable multi-factor authentication</li>\n<li>Utilize reputed antivirus software and internet security packages</li>\n<li>Include a response strategy to contain the threat immediately</li>\n<li>Utilize flash storage solutions and set relevant measures to back up data. This will help promote operational continuity and lower infrastructural costs</li>\n<li>Avoid keeping important files in common locations such as Desktop and My Documents</li>\n<li>Employ an email software security solution that can classify and filter out malicious emails. Employees can also have regular training sessions to gain awareness of the upcoming threats</li>\n<li>Refine and optimize your vulnerability management system. This will help your organization prioritize the vulnerabilities of most concern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations need to empower their employees to understand the current threat landscape better. Investing in the right technologies and creating robust verification measures can ensure that the right individuals can access the right data. Resolving incidents quickly and efficiently in today's fast-paced digital world is imperative.</p>\n<p>Organizations that strategically plan for the next threat will have a positive customer experience in the long run.

While this may have been the first compromised macOS variant, versions 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 built for Windows have been found to incorporate similar additions as early as November 23, 2021.</p>\n<p>rshell, for its part, is a standard backdoor that comes with all the usual bells-and-whistles, allowing for the execution of arbitrary commands received from a command-and-control (C2) server and transmitting the results of the execution back to the server.</p>\n\n<p>It's not immediately clear if MiMi is a legitimate chat program, or if it was \"designed or repurposed as a surveillance tool,\" although the app has been used by another Chinese-speaking actor dubbed <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/exposing-earth-berberoka-a-multiplatform-apt-campaign-targeting-online-gambling-sites\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Earth Berberoka</a> (aka GamblingPuppet) aimed at online gambling sites \u2013 once again indicative of the prevalent tool sharing among Chinese APT groups.</p>\n<p>The operation's connections to Lucky Mouse stems from links to instructure previously identified as used by the China-nexus intrusion set and the deployment of HyperBro, a backdoor exclusively put to use by the hacker group.</p>\n<p>As SEKOIA points out, this is not the first time the adversary has resorted to utilizing a messaging app as a jumping-off point in its attacks. In late 2020, ESET <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/software-supply-chain-attack-hits.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> that a popular chat software called Able Desktop was abused to deliver HyperBro, PlugX, and a remote access trojan called Tmanger targeting Mongolia.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

networks.</p>\n<p>\"Three autonomous threat groups have since adopted and independently developed their own targeted phishing tactics derived from the call back phishing methodology,\" cybersecurity firm AdvIntel <a href=\"https://www.advintel.io/post/bazarcall-advisory-the-essential-guide-to-call-back-phishing-attacks-that-revolutionized-the-data\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a Wednesday report.</p>\n<p>These targeted campaigns \"substantially increased\" attacks against entities in finance, technology, legal, and insurance sectors, the company added.</p>\n<p>The actors in question include Silent Ransom, Quantum, and Roy/Zeon, all of which split from Conti after the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) cartel <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/conti-ransomware-gang-shut-down-after.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">orchestrated its shutdown</a> in May 2022 following its public support for Russia in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The advanced social engineering tactic, also called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/phony-call-centers-tricking-users-into.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BazaCall</a> (aka BazarCall), came under the spotlight in 2020/2021 when it was put to use by operators of the Ryuk ransomware, which later rebranded to Conti.</p>\n<p>It's said to have received substantial operational improvements in May, around the same time the Conti team was busy coordinating an organization-wide restructuring while simulating the movements of an active group.</p>\n\n<p>The phishing attack is also unique in that it forgoes malicious links or attachments in email messages in favor of phone numbers that recipients are tricked into calling by alerting them of an upcoming charge on their credit card for a premium subscription.</p>\n<p>If a target recipient falls for the scheme and decides to call the phone number indicated in the email, a real person from a fraudulent call center set up by BazaCall's operators attempts to convince the victim to grant the customer service person remote desktop control to help cancel the supposed subscription.</p>\n<p>With access to the desktop, the threat actor stealthily takes steps to infiltrate the user's network as well as establish persistence for follow-on activities such as data exfiltration.</p>\n<p>\"Call back phishing was the tactic that enabled a widespread shift in the approach to ransomware deployment,\" AdvIntel said, adding the \"attack vector is intrinsically embedded into the Conti organizational tradition.\" </p>\n<p>Silent Ransom, the \"progenitor of BazarCall\" and the first derivative group to move away from Conti in March 2022, has since been linked to a string of data extortion attacks that entail gaining initial access through subscription expiry emails that claim to notify users of pending payment for Zoho Masterclass and Duolingo services.</p>\n<p>\"These attacks can be categorized as data breach ransom attacks, in which the main focus of the group is to gain access to sensitive documents and information, and demand payment to withhold publication of the stolen data,\" Sygnia <a href=\"https://blog.sygnia.co/luna-moth-false-subscription-scams\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> last month, describing the infection procedure.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli cybersecurity company is tracking the activities of Silent Ransom under the moniker Luna Moth.</p>\n\n<p>The success of Silent Ransom's highly specified phishing operations have also prompted two other Conti spin-offs, namely Quantum and Roy/Zeon, to follow the same approach starting mid-June 2022, while simultaneously giving their own spin.</p>\n<p>While Quantum has been <a href=\"https://www.advintel.io/post/anatomy-of-attack-truth-behind-the-costa-rica-government-ransomware-5-day-intrusion\">implicated</a> in the devastating ransomware attacks on the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/russian-conti-ransomware-gang-threatens.html\">Costa Rican government networks</a> in May, Roy/Zeon \u2013 which consists of members \"responsible for the creation of Ryuk itself\" \u2013 has demonstrated an extremely selective targeting approach, typically favoring companies with high average revenue.</p>\n<p>\"Roy/Zeon, as the most skilled social engineer of the three groups, has the largest number of interchangeable and adjustable [Indicators of Compromise] and impersonation schemes that it selects from based on its target,\" AdvIntel researchers Yelisey Boguslavskiy and Marley Smith pointed out.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that Quantum, also known as the main Conti subdivision, takes its name from another RaaS group of the same name that appeared as a rebranded MountLocker operation in September 2021, before being consumed by Conti in April 2022 during its reorg.</p>\n<p>Unlike Silent Ransom, which uses falsified emails imitating subscription notices as a lure, Quantum's \"increasingly sophisticated\" spam campaigns are known to proliferate via missives impersonating brands like Oracle and CrowdStrike, as <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/callback-malware-campaigns-impersonate-crowdstrike-and-other-cybersecurity-companies/\">divulged</a> by the cybersecurity firm itself last month.</p>\n<p>\"As threat actors have realized the potentialities of weaponized social engineering tactics, it is likely that these phishing operations will only continue to become more elaborate, detailed, and difficult to parse from legitimate communications as time goes on,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>The findings come as industrial cybersecurity company Dragos <a href=\"https://www.dragos.com/blog/dragos-industrial-ransomware-analysis-q2-2022/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> the number of ransomware attacks on industrial infrastructures decreased from 158 in the first quarter of 2022 to 125 in the second quarter, a drop it attributed with low confidence to Conti closing shop.</p>\n<p>That's not all. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic <a href=\"https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/cross-chain-crime-more-than-half-a-billion-dollars-has-been-laundered-through-a-cross-chain-bridge/\">revealed</a> this week that the Russia-linked Ryuk and Conti groups have laundered over $145 million in crypto assets through RenBridge, a cross-chain bridge that allows virtual funds to be transferred between blockchains, since 2020, underscoring the continued abuse of the decentralized and unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>Today's web has made hackers' tasks remarkably easy. For the most part, hackers don't even have to hide in the dark recesses of the web to take advantage of people any longer; they can be found right in plain sight on social media sites or forums, professionally advertised with their websites, and may even approach you anonymously through such channels as Twitter.</p>\n<p>Cybercrime has entered a new era where people don't steal just for the thrill of doing it anymore. They make it their business to carry out illegal cyber activities in small groups or individually to earn business from online criminals, selling offensive services like spyware as a service or commercial cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>For instance, a series of new DDoS for Hire are commoditizing the art of hacking and reducing the barrier to launching <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/ddos-protection-mitigation-and-defense-8-essential-tips/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-hacker-for-hire\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DDoS attacks</strong></a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Who are Hackers-for-Hire? </strong></h2>\n<p>Hackers-for-hire are secret cyber experts or groups who specialize in infiltrating organizations to acquire intelligence in one way or another. They offer their services to people who encounter problems when trying to break into an organization for various reasons, for example, lack of skills necessary for the operation or simply because they cannot do it by themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A hacker would like to steal the private email of a person going through a divorce, separation, or child custody case. Why? Because hackers don't mind breaking the law and getting involved in financial and legal disputes as long as they can benefit financially.</li>\n<li>False information and malicious actions on social media can cause social confusion (not just political).</li>\n<li>A hackers-for-hire group would attempt to access bank accounts to execute <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/best-practices-to-protect-your-business-from-data-breach/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-hacker-for-hire\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>data breaches</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which they could sell on the black market at a percentage of the account's current cash balance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Hackers-for-Hire Emerge as A Threat </strong></h2>\n<p>Since 2020, Hackers-for-hire has had unprecedented access to computer networks and have posed as hackers and users contracted to perform different kinds of work for them. For example, COVID-19 was seen as a big threat because it gave hackers something that we might see in the future more often-- the ability to use computers via clever public communications channels like Twitter and email.</p>\n<p>If any of your assets are valuable, and if others have a vested interest in taking these assets away from you, you should expect to be the target of an attack.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How Hack-For-Hire Operations Work </strong></h2>\n<p>To get a general overview of the whole process, we can break everything down into three phases that make up a surveillance chain. The first phase involves reconnaissance, where hackers will gather as much information about their target's company or business as they can by using various tools and techniques. This informative phase will then inform phase 2, where hackers will carry out attacks to damage their target. </p>\n<p>Let's try to understand the working as follows:</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>1 \u2014 Reconnaissance</b></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>In the reconnaissance stage, cyber hackers start as information gatherers and data miners when they start to profile their targets silently. A few examples of how they do this is by gathering information about them from publicly available sources such as blogs, social media, knowledge management platforms like Wikipedia and Wikidata, news media, forums, etc. (this can involve scraping dark websites too). </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>2 \u2014 Engagement </b></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>During the Engagement phase, an attacker, using the power of social engineering, tries to build trust with you and uses that as a way to gain your confidence and trick you into sharing confidential information. The attacker's objective is to get you excited about clicking on what they might refer to as a \"special link\" or downloading a file that they say will give you more details. Social engineering is a form of manipulation that might be directed through tricking, deceiving, or even blackmailing an individual. By talking to the people, you are after information, you can eventually gain access or manipulate them into answering your questions.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>3 \u2014 Exploitation </b></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>A hacker's primary objective during the exploitation stage is to gain access to surveillance for mobile phones or computers.</p>\n<p>A hacker can access personal data on a victim's phone or computer by taking advantage of keyloggers and phishing websites. These elements allow them to steal sensitive information like passwords, cookies, access tokens, photos, videos, messages, and more. They may be able to hack into the microphone on your cell phone or the camera on your computer to activate them even without your knowledge.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Who are Hackers-for-Hire Targets? </strong></h2>\n<p>Cybercriminals have a soft spot for targeting companies that would have access to sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card details, etc. They target every kind of organization, including financial, Hospitals, cellular equipment vendors, and radio and satellite communication companies in the hope of exposing sensitive details. Sometimes they focus on individuals like CIOs, Human rights activists, workers like journalists, politicians, telecommunications engineers, and medical doctors, etc.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How to Protect Businesses from Hackers-for-Hire? </strong></h2>\n<p>By far, the most common attack when it comes to hacking is phishing. Many cybercriminals will use this method as a starting point and generally do not go further than the compromise of email accounts and data exfiltration. This means that threat actors don't necessarily need any malware because basic social engineering tricks can be enough.</p>\n<p>But what can we do at our end to safeguard our critical assets from prying eyes? Let's discuss the top four ways.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u2014 <strong>Scan your Assets</strong></h4>\n<p>With a vulnerability assessment service, you'll be able to identify common security vulnerabilities in your websites and applications and related libraries that are likely a result of weak coding. It can then be passed onto an application developer so they know what holes in the code they might need to patch up.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u2014 <strong>Pen Testing </strong></h4>\n<p>Penetration testing is detecting and analyzing potential security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, white hat hacking, or security testing, is a type of validation testing used to attack a computer system to find vulnerabilities within the target application, network, or device.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u2014 <strong>Keep Apps Up-To-Date </strong></h4>\n<p><strong>I</strong>f you're seeking to beef up your application's security, an important aspect is constant sync testing and patching of web applications, which need to be protected. An organization needs to be able to stay on top of new threats and vulnerability patches as soon as possible, so it's necessary to update your security suite regularly.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u2014 <strong>Prepare to Block Attacks</strong></h4>\n<p>No matter how well you ensure your network is guarded against hackers, there will always be cyber-criminals just waiting for the right opportunity to wreak havoc with attacks like DDoS.</p>\n<p>A way to thwart the biggest and most powerful cyber-attack is to ensure that you have an anti-DDoS cyber shield in place. <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/web-application-firewall.php?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-hacker-for-hire\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AppTrana WAF</strong></a>, from the Indusface, stops malicious traffic to keep hackers away from the site.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>\n<p>Information security researchers believe that to effectively detect and repair web application security vulnerabilities, individuals/groups should adopt a combination of static and dynamic web application testing methods backed by a web application firewall for instant virtual patching for the detectable defects within your system.</p>\n<p>Trusted security partners are like skilled bodyguards. They stay on top of the latest methods to access confidential information and carry out regular monitoring rounds to keep your data safe from any security breaches.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Should an employee get past the login step, the phishing page was engineered to automatically download AnyDesk's remote access software, which, if installed, could be used to commandeer the victim's system.</p>\n<p>Besides working with DigitalOcean to shut down the attacker's server, the company also said it reset the credentials of the impacted employees and that it's tightening up its access implementation to prevent any logins from unknown VPNs, residential proxies, and infrastructure providers.</p>\n<p>The development comes days after Twilio said unknown hackers succeeded in phishing the credentials of an undisclosed number of employees and gained unauthorized access to the company's internal systems, using it to get hold of customer accounts.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It's believed to operate out of South Asia and recently expanded focus to <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/bitter-apt-hackers-continue-to-target.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strike military entities</a> in Bangladesh.</p>\n<h3>Transparent Tribe targets governments with LazaSpy malware</h3>\n<p>The second collective to be disrupted by Meta is Transparent Tribe (aka APT36), an advanced persistent threat alleged to be based out of Pakistan and which has a track record of targeting government agencies in India and Afghanistan with bespoke malicious tools.</p>\n<p>Last month, Cisco Talos <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/pakistani-hackers-targeting-indian.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attributed</a> the actor to an ongoing phishing campaign targeting students at various educational institutions in India, marking a departure from its typical victimology pattern to include civilian users.</p>\n<p>The latest set of intrusions suggest an amalgamation, having singled out military personnel, government officials, employees of human rights and other non-profit organizations, and students located in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E.</p>\n\n<p>The targets were social engineered using fake personas by posing as recruiters for both legitimate and fake companies, military personnel, or attractive young women looking to make a romantic connection, ultimately enticing them into opening links hosting malware.</p>\n<p>The downloaded files contained LazaSpy, a modified version of an open source Android monitoring software called <a href=\"https://github.com/XploitWizer-Community/XploitSPY\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XploitSPY</a>, while also making use of unofficial WhatsApp, WeChat and YouTube clone apps to deliver another commodity malware known as Mobzsar (aka CapraSpy).</p>\n<p>Both pieces of malware come with features to gather call logs, contacts, files, text messages, geolocation, device information, and photos, as well as enable the device's microphone, making them effective surveillance tools.</p>\n<p>\"This threat actor is a good example of a global trend [...] where low-sophistication groups choose to rely on openly available malicious tools, rather than invest in developing or buying sophisticated offensive capabilities,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>These \"basic low-cost tools [...] require less technical expertise to deploy, yet yield results for the attackers nonetheless,\" the company said, adding it \"democratizes access to hacking and surveillance capabilities as the barrier to entry becomes lower.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

As a third layer of security, the RSA keys are encrypted using a hard-coded RSA public key that's unique to each campaign.</p>\n<p>What sets Maui apart from other traditional ransomware offerings is also the fact that it's not offered as a service to other affiliates for use in return for a share of monetary profits.</p>\n<p>In some instances, the ransomware incidents are said to have disrupted health services for extended periods of time. The initial infection vector used to conduct the intrusions is unknown as yet.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that the campaign is predicated on the willingness of healthcare entities to pay ransoms to quickly recover from an attack and ensure uninterrupted access to critical services. It's the latest indication of how North Korean adversaries are adapting their tactics to illegally generate a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/us-warns-against-north-korean-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">constant stream</a> of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/north-korean-hackers-suspected-to-be.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revenue</a> for the cash-strapped nation.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Sophos' <a href=\"https://www.sophos.com/en-us/press-office/press-releases/2022/06/ransomware-attacks-on-healthcare-organizations-increased-94-percent-in-2021\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of Ransomware in Healthcare 2022</a> report, 61% of healthcare organizations surveyed opted to settle compared with the global average of 46%, with only 2% of those that paid the ransom in 2021 getting their complete data back.</p>\n<p>That said, the use of a manually operated ransomware family by an APT group also raises the possibility that the operation could be a diversionary tactic designed to act as a cover for other malicious motives, as recently observed in the case of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/state-backed-hackers-using-ransomware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bronze Starlight</a>. </p>\n<p>\"Nation state-sponsored ransomware attacks have become typical international acts of aggression,\" Peter Martini, co-founder of iboss, said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, North Korea specifically has shown it is very willing to indiscriminately target various industries, including healthcare, to secure untraceable cryptocurrency that is funding its nuclear weapons program.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The notorious REvil <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/ransomware-protection/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-revil-back\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ransomware</strong></a> gang, linked to the infamous JBS and Kaseya, has resurfaced three months after the arrest of its members in Russia.</p>\n<p>The Russian domestic intelligence service, the FSB, had caught 14 people from the gang. In this apprehension, the 14 members of the gang were found in possession of 426 million roubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, and 20 luxury cars were brought to justice.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>REvil Ransomware Gang- The Context</strong></h2>\n<p>The financially-motivated cybercriminal threat group Gold Southfield controlled ransomware group known as REvil emerged in 2019 and spread like wildfire after extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS.</p>\n<p>REvil would incentivize its affiliates to carry out cyberattacks for them by giving a percentage of the ransom pay-outs to those who help with infiltration activities on targeted computers.</p>\n<p>In July 2021, hackers working under REvil exploited <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/blog/the-truth-about-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-web-application-security/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-revil-back\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>zero-day vulnerabilities</strong> </a>in Managed Service Provider (MSP)service developed by a company called Kaseya. As is often the case, these vulnerabilities had not been patched and were therefore open for exploitation. The code change was deployed globally against over 30 MSPs worldwide and 1,000 business networks managed by those MSPs.</p>\n<p>The hackers rented their ransomware to other cyber criminals so that a similar attack could occur and disrupt the activities of others. It's been reported how sustained ransomware attacks were conducted revealed that most hacking groups utilize Ransomware-as-service by renting out their services to other users (who often have easy access to the victim's systems, networks, and other personal information). The famous Colonial Pipeline, the oil pipeline company, operating in the United States, was <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/ransomware-cyber-attack-forced-largest.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attacked by REvil</a> as part of a Ransomware service.</p>\n<p>In October 2021, a multi-country law enforcement operation seized control of REvil's main ransomware-related resources and dismantled the darknet campaign that was being conducted on anonymous ToR servers.</p>\n<p>But thanks to the U.S.-Russian collaboration, the REvil gang was dismantled, and the group itself was hacked. The crime group's \"Happy Blog\" website, used to leak victim data and extort companies and provide an avenue for commending members involved in successful attacks, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was forced offline</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>ReVil Making a Comeback </strong></h2>\n<p>Cybersecurity researchers have put forward samples of REvil ransomware. Their findings, based on the findings of samples which all showed identical creation dates and compilation strings along with several other attributes, which mean the same person/team probably makes it - strengthens their argument that they have indeed identified the original REvil ransomware developer and should logically, therefore, conclude that the self-exiled cybercriminal group known as REvil has returned. Recently, the latest Ransomware leak site was promoted through the Russian forum RuTOR \u2013 a website that allegedly markets leaked data to customers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>As Per Vines,</strong> <strong>REvil's Tor Sites Have Come Back to Life. </strong></h2>\n<p>In late April of this year, security researchers noticed some malware found in previous</p>\n<p>attacks had resumed activity after a long period of quiet. Two researchers who are into the dark side of cybersecurity recently uncovered a blog on the dark web that is used to publish ransomware attacks, and it was enticing others to take part in this dangerous trend. They also came across news that attackers have taken it upon themselves to recruit more ghost hackers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ransomware sample confirms the return: </strong></h2>\n<p>The latest sample has made use of longer GUID-type values, such as</p>\n<p>3c852cc8-b7f1-436e-ba3b-c53b7fc6c0e4 for the SUB and PID options to track campaign and affiliate identities, respectively.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Is REvil Back? - How Can You Fight Back?</strong></h2>\n<p>REvil is known for being particularly destructive ransomware, and its return means that businesses and individuals need to be on high alert for possible attacks. It is too early to tell if the REvil ransomware gang's comeback will be as effective as its predecessor.</p>\n<p>But the fact that it surfaced soon after the takedown operation indicates that this may be their intent, and best ransomware protection and web security practices are suggested to be a regularity. </p>\n<p>When it comes to safeguarding your website from hackers and criminals, there are several methodologies you can use - some of which include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using an automated web application scanner, manual penetration testing.</li>\n<li>Setting up anti-malware &amp; anti-virus programs for regular security scans and so on. </li>\n<li>Implement security training programs \u2013 your end-users and employees should know the ransomware threat and how it is launched.</li>\n<li>Enabling the principle of \"least privilege\" for application users will help you ensure that no one can access any part of your application that another user doesn't also have access to, which will allow them to avoid any security breaches from happening.</li>\n<li>Support your information security department by introducing cyber threat awareness initiatives that teach end-users and employees how to recognize cyber criminals' modus operandi.</li>\n<li>Ensure your business is protected from downloading any executable files attached to incoming or outgoing emails so your website's application isn't vulnerable to hackers.</li>\n<li>To stop cyber attackers from breaking into your web applications, it is suggested to configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block access to malicious IP addresses.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, installing proper SSL certificates for protection against Man-In-The-Middle attacks or using login plugins that verify the client's security token can reduce the risk of succumbing to data breaches.</li>\n<li>Bring in the support from trusted managed cybersecurity service providers like <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-article&amp;utm_campaign=thehackernews-revil-back\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Indusface</strong></a> to stay ahead of emerging threats and assist in addressing real-time security issues. Make sure they have the appropriate certifications, keep up to date on the latest cybersecurity news, and are always available should you need in-the-field assistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>It won't be a surprise if the REvil ransomware group resumes attacks as the original creator(s) of the previous incarnation still exist. Even those caught are likely to attempt it again in the future, which is especially scary if you think about how prepared these online crooks are.</p>\n<p>Getting your customers' digital identities, servers, and data files stolen because of ransomware could mean losing a lot of time and money as these attacks only get worse with time. </p>\n<p>Also, the importance of protecting your reputation or avoiding getting it damaged can arguably be beyond measure. Therefore, businesses must ensure that their brand, intellectual property, and personal or sensitive information are protected from cyber criminals who use ransomware attacks daily.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

indicating that Diavol is being deployed by the same set of actors behind Conti and Karakurt.</p>\n<p>Further forensic examination of an unnamed client that was hit with a subsequent wave of extortion attacks following a Conti ransomware infection has revealed that the second group used the same Cobalt Strike backdoor left behind by Conti, implying a strong association between seemingly disparate cybercrime actors.</p>\n<p>\"Whether Karakurt is an elaborate side hustle by Conti and Diavol operatives or whether this is an enterprise sanctioned by the overall organization remains to be seen,\" Arctic Wolf said.</p>\n<p>\"This connection perhaps explains why Karakurt is surviving and thriving despite some of its exfiltration-only competitors dying out,\" the researchers said, adding, \"Or, alternatively, perhaps this was the trial run of a strategic diversification authorized by the main group.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Metadata associated with the executable (\"<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a294620543334a721a2ae8eaaf9680a0786f4b9a216d75b55cfd28f39e9430ea/details\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caddy.exe</a>\") shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior to its deployment.</p>\n<p>CaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn't share any similarities with previously discovered wipers in Ukraine, including <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-wiper-malware-targeting-ukraine.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HermeticWiper</a> (aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/second-new-isaacwiper-data-wiper.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IsaacWiper</a> (aka Lasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and commercial entities.</p>\n\n<p>\"The ultimate goal of the attackers is the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321\">same</a> as with IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper: make the systems unusable by erasing user data and partition information,\" Jean-Ian Boutin\u00b8 head of threat research at ESET, told The Hacker News. \"All of the organizations targeted by the recent wiper attacks were either in the governmental or financial sector.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike CaddyWiper, both the HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper malware families are said to have been in development for months in advance before their release, with oldest known samples compiled on December 28 and October 19, 2021, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>But the newly discovered wiper shares one tactical overlap with HermeticWiper in that the malware, in one instance, was deployed via the Windows domain controller, indicating that the attackers had taken control of the Active Directory server.</p>\n<p>\"Interestingly, CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers,\" the company said. \"This is probably a way for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing operations.\"</p>\n<p>The wiper is programmed to systematically destroy all files located in \"C:\\Users,\" before moving on to the next <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_letter_assignment\">drive letter</a> and erasing the files until it reaches the \"Z\" drive, meaning CaddyWiper will also attempt to wipe any network mapped drive attached to the system.</p>\n\n<p>\"The file destruction algorithm is composed of two stages: a first stage to overwrite files and another to destroy the physical disk layout and the partition tables along with it,\" Cisco Talos researchers <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/threat-advisory-caddywiper.html\">said</a> in an analysis of the malware. \"Destroying the start of the files and the partitions tables is a common technique seen on other wipers, and its highly effective in preventing file recovery.\"</p>\n<p>Microsoft, which has attributed the HermeticWiper attacks to a threat cluster tracked as DEV-0665, said the \"intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of targeted resources\" in the country.</p>\n<p>The development also arrives as cybercriminals have opportunistically and increasingly capitalized on the conflict to design phishing lures, including themes of humanitarian assistance and various types of fundraising, to deliver a variety of backdoors such as Remcos.</p>\n<p>\"The global interest in the ongoing war in Ukraine makes it a convenient and effective news event for cybercriminals to exploit,\" Cisco Talos researchers <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/ukraine-invasion-scams-malware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"If a certain topic of lure is going to increase the chances of a potential victim installing their payload, they will use it.\"</p>\n<p>But it's not just Ukraine that's been at the receiving end of wiper attacks.

Analysis of the campaign has revealed that SockDetour was delivered from an external FTP server to a U.S.-based defense contractor's internet-facing Windows server on July 27, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>\"The FTP server that hosted SockDetour was a compromised Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) small office and home office (SOHO) network-attached storage (NAS) server,\" the researchers pointed out. \"The NAS server is known to have multiple vulnerabilities, including a <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ech0raix-ransomware-soho/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remote code execution</a> vulnerability, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-qnap-nas-flaws-exploited-in-recent.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2021-28799</a>.\"</p>\n<p>What's more, the same server is said to have been already infected with the QLocker ransomware, raising the possibility the TiltedTemple actor leveraged the aforementioned flaw to gain unauthorized initial access.</p>\n<p>SockDetour, for its part, is fashioned as a stand-in backdoor that hijacks legitimate processes' network sockets to establish its own encrypted C2 channel, followed by loading an unidentified plugin DLL file retrieved from the server.</p>\n<p>\"Thus, SockDetour requires neither opening a listening port from which to receive a connection nor calling out to an external network to establish a remote C2 channel,\" the researchers said. \"This makes the backdoor more difficult to detect from both host and network level.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Also deployed is a newly identified PowerShell backdoor that's used to execute commands received from the attacker.</p>\n<p>To create barriers for potential attacks, the agencies are recommending organizations to use multi-factor authentication wherever applicable, limit the use of administrator privileges, implement phishing protections, and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Taken together, the different pieces of malware enabled the adversary to capture screenshots, receive commands from a remote server, and carry out other malicious activities.</p>\n<p>\"On one hand, the attackers managed to pull off a complicated operation to bypass security systems and network segmentation, penetrate the broadcaster's networks, produce and run the malicious tools that heavily rely on internal knowledge of the broadcasting software used by victims, all while staying under the radar during the reconnaissance and initial intrusion stages,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>\"On the other hand, the attackers' tools are of relatively low quality and sophistication, and are launched by clumsy and sometimes buggy 3-line batch scripts.

Most definitely not! Every business is a potential DDoS target. Read on to know why and what measures to take to keep your business effectively protected. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Common DDoS Targets</strong></h2>\n<p>Even though every business can be targeted by attackers, some industries and businesses are more highly targeted. As mentioned earlier, banks and financial institutions were the biggest DDoS targets in 2021. Other commonly targeted industries are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educational institutions </li>\n<li>Wired telecommunication carriers</li>\n<li>Online gaming and gambling</li>\n<li>Wireless telecom carriers</li>\n<li>Healthcare</li>\n<li>Governments and their agencies </li>\n<li>ISP, hosting, and related services</li>\n<li>Remote learning companies</li>\n<li>Technology companies, especially with the rise in telecommuting </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also critical to note that SMEs are targeted as much by threat actors as large businesses and corporates. It is a common misconception among SMEs that they will not be targeted and take a lax approach towards DDoS mitigation. Attackers take advantage of this laid-back approach to orchestrate DDoS attacks against SMEs. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4 Reasons Why Every Business is a Potential Target</strong></h2>\n<br/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Lackadaisical Approach to DDoS Prevention and Security </strong></h4>\n<p>Despite the advent of technology, several businesses continue to use traditional tools such as legacy firewalls and dated methods such as signature-based traffic monitoring to protect against DDoS. The attacks today are more sophisticated than ever, and traditional security measures do not suffice. Even attacks that last for a few minutes brings significant financial and reputational damage. </p>\n<p>It is also critical to note that SMEs are targeted by threat actors as much as large businesses and corporate houses. As attacks against larger corporations tend to make the headlines, it is a common misconception among SMEs that they will not be targeted. So, they tend to take a lax approach towards DDoS mitigation. Attackers take advantage of this laid-back approach to orchestrate DDoS attacks against SMEs. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Growing Attack Surface </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>The pandemic has significantly accelerated digitization among all kinds of organizations, including government, non-profits, and SMEs. Further, the use of BYOT devices remotely from shared (often insecure) networks has shot up. As the result, every organization has a widening attack surface and an increased risk of DDoS threats. The problem is exacerbated when organizations do not understand the importance of DDoS protection and rely on generic solutions and default solutions provided by the hosting/ ISP/ cloud service provider. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3 </strong>\u2014 <strong>DDoS Attacks are Easy and Economical to Orchestrate </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>A large percentage of DDoS attacks in the past few years have lasted for less than 4 hours. Even though the attacks lasted for a shorter duration, their intensity, frequency, and severity have increased manifold. Today, sophisticated, multi-vector, and smart DDoS attacks are easy and cost-effective to orchestrate more than ever owing to the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technological advances</li>\n<li>Easy availability of malware tools and botnets</li>\n<li>Availability of DDoS-as-a-service and hacking-as-a-service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, attackers can launch attacks with almost zero effort. Further, the financial benefits of DDoS attacks are high, making them lucrative for attackers. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Potent Tool for Competitors and Disgruntled Employees</strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Websites that keep crashing or have frequent downtimes (often caused by DDoS attacks) or have their webpages vandalized lose their search engine rankings and reputation. So, competitors and even disgruntled employees often use DDoS as a tactic to erode your search engine rankings and bring about significant reputational damage.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Importance of DDoS Protection </strong></h2>\n<p>Before moving on to how to prevent these attacks, it is critical to understand the importance of DDoS protection. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Your website is Always Available </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most direct and immediate impacts of DDoS is that it overwhelms the website with excessive requests, erodes its resources, and makes it unavailable to legitimate traffic. Until the attack is stopped, any business engagement through the website would be unavailable. It hurts the brand image and business reputation. </p>\n<p>With effective <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/managed-ddos-protection-mitigation.php/?utm_source=hackernews-article&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=hackersnews-article-reasons-why-every-business-is-a-target-of-ddos-attacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS protection</a>, businesses can ensure that their website and digital assets are always available. Such DDoS services include globally distributed content delivery networks (CDN) that help accelerate the website speed and performance without compromising on the security front. </p>\n<p></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Steer Away Erosion of Search Engine Rankings</strong></h4><p></p>\n<p>DDoS attacks cause websites to crash, experience downtime, and become unavailable to legit users. Websites that keep crashing or have frequent downtimes lose their search engine rankings. Further, if the website owners do not have backups or do not know how to stop the attack, they will end up losing the search engine's listing of internal links. So, competitors often use DDoS as a tactic to divert traffic to their website and erode your search engine rankings. With intelligent DDoS protection, all this can be avoided. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Keep Your Website Protected Against Other Kinds of Attacks </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>DDoS attacks are used as smokescreens for other cyberattacks such as malware attacks, creating backdoors, account takeover, extortion, content, and price scraping, etc. With integrated, end-to-end DDoS services, you can monitor the incoming traffic continuously, secure vulnerabilities before attackers find them, and keep your digital assets fully protected. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Eliminate Possibilities of Cyber-Vandalism and Website Defacements </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>DDoS attacks are leveraged by competitors, enemy nation-states, governments, hacktivists, and others for cyber-vandalism and website defacements against companies, governmental agencies, and not-for-profit organizations. To avert being targeted by such actors, DDoS protection is a must. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>5 </strong>\u2014 <strong>Save Time, Money, and Other Resources </strong></h4><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Last but not least, DDoS attacks like others bring extraordinary financial and reputational damage. When websites are protected by managed, intuitive DDoS prevention services, massive amounts of time, money, and effort are saved. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Way Forward: How to Keep Yourself Protected? </strong></h2>\n<p>The best way to keep yourself protected from DDoS attacks is to take a proactive approach to security and onboarding an intelligent, managed, and advanced DDoS protection service such as AppTrana. <a href=\"https://www.indusface.com/web-application-firewall.php/?utm_source=hackernews-article&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=hackersnews-article-reasons-why-every-business-is-a-target-of-ddos-attacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Indusface AppTrana</strong></a> helps you ensure that you do not become a DDoS target while also helping you accelerate website performance and speed. </p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Opening the decoy file redirects the message recipient to a web page prompting the user to save an ISO file.</p>\n<p>But unlike other attacks that route the victim to a phishing domain set up explicitly for downloading the next-stage malware, the latest RAT campaign cleverly uses JavaScript to locally create the ISO file from a Base64-encoded string and mimic the download process.</p>\n\n<p>\"The ISO download is not generated from a remote server but from within the victim's browser by a JavaScript code that's embedded inside the HTML receipt file,\" Dereviashkin explained.</p>\n<p>When the victim opens the ISO file, it is automatically mounted as a DVD Drive on the Windows host and includes either a .BAT or a .VBS file, which continues the infection chain to retrieve a next-stage component via a PowerShell command execution.</p>\n<p>This results in the execution of a .NET module in-memory that subsequently acts as a dropper for three files \u2014 one acting as a trigger for the next \u2014 to finally deliver AsyncRAT as the final payload, while also checking for antivirus software and setting up Windows Defender exclusions.</p>\n\n<p>RATs such as AsyncRAT are typically used to forge a remote link between a threat actor and a victim device, steal information, and conduct surveillance through microphones and cameras. They provide an array of advanced capabilities that give the attackers the ability to fully monitor and control the compromised machines.</p>\n<p>Morphisec also pointed out the campaign's advanced tactics, which it said allowed the malware to slip through <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1241b9486d3d7c74c0bb1f2a7bdd81ff9597b2c92f2af8a5b3819b296c400336\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">virtually</a> <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/50d308118008908832fe9c7fa78169ef8aaa960450c788a2c41af0eb5e0a62db\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">undetected</a> by most antimalware engines despite the operation being in effect for close to five months.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Should a potential target use a Chrome extension like Metamask to manage crypto wallets, the adversary stealthily moves to locally replace the main component of the extension with a fake version that alerts the operators every time a large transfer is kicked off to another account.</p>\n<p>In the final phase, the funds are subsequently diverted by performing a malicious code injection to intercept and modify the transaction details on demand. \"The attackers modify not only the recipient [wallet] address, but also push the amount of currency to the limit, essentially draining the account in one move,\" the researchers <a href=\"https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Cryptocurrency is a heavily targeted sector when it comes to cybercrime due to the decentralized nature of the currencies and the fact that, unlike with credit card or bank transfers, the transaction happens quickly and is impossible to reverse,\" Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\"Nation-states, especially those under strict tariffs or other financial restrictions, can benefit greatly by stealing and manipulating cryptocurrency. Many times, a cryptocurrency wallet can contain multiple types of cryptocurrency, making them a very appealing target,\" Kron added.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>The last several years have seen an ever-increasing number of cyber-attacks, and while the frequency of such attacks has increased, so too has the resulting damage. One needs only to look at <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CISA's list of significant cyber incidents</a> to appreciate the magnitude of the problem. In May of 2021, for example, a ransomware attack brought down the Colonial Pipeline, causing a serious fuel disruption for much of the United States.</p>\n<p>Just last month, a hacking group gained access to call logs and text messages from telecommunications carriers all over the world. These are just two of dozens of cyber-attacks occurring this year.</p>\n<p>Because of these and other cyber security incidents, the Department of Homeland Security issues a <a href=\"https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compulsory directive</a> to federal agencies to better protect federal information systems and the data that they contain against cyber-attack. This directive is based around <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CISA's catalog of vulnerabilities</a> that are known to pose a significant risk. The directive requires covered entities to update their cyber security procedures and to address known vulnerabilities within a specific amount of time.</p>\n<h2>End of year preparations for CISA</h2>\n<p>The fact that the Federal Government is suddenly placing such a high priority on cyber security is telling, and the directive is worth paying attention to, even for private sector organizations. If federal agencies shore up their cyber defenses in accordance with the new directive, then at least some cybercriminals will likely turn their attention toward attacking private sector targets. After all, it is likely that some of the known vulnerabilities will continue to exist in private companies, even after those vulnerabilities have been addressed on systems belonging to the federal government.</p>\n<p>With the end of the year rapidly approaching, IT professionals should put cyber security at the top of their New Year's resolutions. But what specifically should IT pros be doing to prepare for 2022?</p>\n<p>CISA differentiates between known vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities that are known to have been exploited. Likewise, IT pros in the private sector should focus their efforts and their security resources on addressing vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the real world. Such exploits are well documented and pose a major threat to organizations who fail to address such vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>Deploy patches immediately </h3>\n<p>The single most important thing that organizations can do to ensure that they address known security vulnerabilities is to apply security patches as they become available. Many security patches are specifically designed to address known vulnerabilities, some of which have already been exploited. For example, the <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Exchange Server update addressed the ProxyShell vulnerability</a> earlier this year. ProxyShell was the name given to a serious Exchange Server vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution. Once the vulnerability became public, attackers began actively searching for unpatched Exchange Servers, often installing ransomware onto the servers that were located. </p>\n<p>Don't forget that <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/why-holidays-put-your-company-at-risk.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">holidays can increase your organization's risk of cyber-attack</a>, so although a patch may come through at an inopportune moment, it's important to push through immediately as hackers are waiting for lapses in your security network this time of year. </p>\n<p>As important as patch management may be, installing the available security patches is only one example of the types of things that IT pros need to be doing in order to address known security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>Prevent breached passwords in your network</h3>\n<p>Another countermeasure that is nearly as important but widely overlooked is that of preventing users from using passwords that are known to have been compromised.</p>\n<p>Hackers maintain massive dark web databases of passwords that have been cracked as a part of various exploits. The reason why this is such a problem is because users very often use their work passwords on various websites to minimize the number of passwords that they must remember. If a password has been cracked, then it means that there is a table matching that password to its hash. This makes it possible for an attacker to recognize when that password has been used elsewhere. This is why it's so important to prevent users from using any password that is known to be compromised.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-policy/?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNews+blog\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specops Password Policy</a> includes a breach password feature that queries databases containing billions of compromised passwords to make sure that those passwords are not being used on your network.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Specops Password Policy includes features that are designed to help IT pros to create compliant password policies. The software includes built-in templates that allow you to create password policies that are based on the standards set forth by NIST, SANS, and others. Using these templates makes it easy to ensure that the passwords used throughout your organization adhere to the same NIST standards that the federal government is adhering to. <a href=\"https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-policy/?utm_source=hackernews&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNews+blog\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can try the software in your AD organization free for 14 days</a>. </p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Avast said it was making its findings public after unsuccessful attempts to directly notify the agency about the intrusion and through other channels put in place by the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>At this stage, only \"parts of the attack puzzle\" have been uncovered, leaving the door open for a lot of unknowns with regards to the nature of the initial access vector used to breach the network, the sequence of post-exploitation actions taken by the actor, and the overall impact of the compromise itself.</p>\n\n<p>What's known is that the attack was carried out in two stages to deploy two malicious binaries, the first of which potentially enabled the unidentified adversary to intercept internet traffic and execute code of their choosing, permitting the operators to take complete control over the infected systems. It achieves this by abusing <a href=\"https://www.reqrypt.org/windivert.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WinDivert</a>, a legitimate packet capturing utility for Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, not only both the samples masquerade as an Oracle library named \"<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e10646/oci01int.htm#LNOCI010\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">oci.dll</a>,\" the second-stage decryptor deployed during the attack was found to share similarities with another executable detailed by Trend Micro researchers in 2018, which delved into an information theft-driven supply chain attack dubbed \"<a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_my/research/18/h/supply-chain-attack-operation-red-signature-targets-south-korean-organizations.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Red Signature</a>\" aimed at organizations in South Korea. The overlaps have led the Avast Threat Intelligence Team to suspect that the attackers have had access to the source code of the latter.</p>\n<p>\"It is reasonable to presume that some form of data gathering and exfiltration of network traffic happened, but that is informed speculation,\" the researchers said. \"That said, we have no way to know for sure the size and scope of this attack beyond what we've seen.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Approximately a third (29.4%) of non-ICS computers are situated in Russia (10.1%), India (10%), and Brazil (9.3%).</p>\n\n<p>\"The PseudoManuscrypt loader makes its way onto user systems via a MaaS platform that distributes malware in pirated software installer archives,\" the Kaspersky ICS CERT team <a href=\"https://securelist.com/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/105286/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"One specific case of the PseudoManuscrypt downloader's distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet.\"</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, Glupteba's operations have also taken a significant hit after Google earlier this month <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/google-disrupts-blockchain-based.html\">disclosed</a> that it acted to dismantle the botnet's infrastructure and it's pursuing a litigation against two Russian nationals, who are alleged to have managed the malware along with 15 other unnamed individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Among the cracked installers that are used to fuel the botnet constitute Windows 10, Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Garmin, Call of Duty, SolarWinds Engineer's Toolset, and even Kaspersky's own antivirus solution. The pirated software installations are driven by a <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/ubiquitous-seo-poisoning-urls-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">method</a> called <a href=\"https://www.menlosecurity.com/blog/holy-seo-poisoning/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">search poisoning</a> in which the attackers create malicious websites and use search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to make them show up prominently in search results.</p>\n<p>Once installed, PseudoManuscrypt comes with an array of intrusive capabilities that allows the attackers to full control of the infected system. This consists of disabling antivirus solutions, stealing VPN connection data, logging keystrokes, recording audio, capturing screenshots and videos of the screen, and intercepting data stored in the clipboard.</p>\n\n<p>Kaspersky noted it has identified 100 different versions of the PseudoManuscrypt loader, with the earliest test variants dating back to March 27, 2021. Components of the trojan have been borrowed from commodity malware like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:Win32/Fabookie!MSR&amp;ThreatID=2147763490\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fabookie</a> and a KCP protocol library employed by the China-based <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APT41</a> group for sending data back to the attackers' command-and-control (C2) servers.</p>\n<p>The malware samples analyzed by the ICS CERT also featured comments written in Chinese and were found specifying Chinese as the preferred language when connecting to the C2 server, but these clues alone have been inconclusive to make an assessment about the malware's operators or their origins. Also unclear are the ultimate goals of the campaign, raising questions as to whether the attacks are financially motivated or state-backed.</p>\n<p>\"The large number of engineering computers attacked, including systems used for 3D and physical modeling, the development and use of digital twins raises the issue of industrial espionage as one of the possible objectives of the campaign,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In August 2021, an exhaustive study of the IIS threat landscape by Slovak cybersecurity company ESET <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/several-malware-families-targeting-iis.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> as many as 14 malware families that were developed as native IIS modules in an attempt to intercept HTTP traffic and remotely commandeer the compromised computers.</p>\n\n<p>As a persistent component on the compromised system, Owawa is engineered to capture the credentials of users who are successfully authenticated on the OWA authentication web page. Exploitation can then be achieved by sending \"seemingly innocuous requests\" to the exposed web services by entering specifically crafted commands within the username and password fields in the OWA authentication page of a compromised server.</p>\n<p>Specifically, if the OWA username is \"jFuLIXpzRdateYHoVwMlfc,\" Owawa responds back with the encrypted credentials. If the username, on the other hand, is \"dEUM3jZXaDiob8BrqSy2PQO1\", the PowerShell command typed in the OWA password field is executed, the results of which are sent back to the attacker.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian security firm said it detected a cluster of targets with compromised servers located in Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia, and the Philippines that primarily belong to government organizations, with the exception of one server that's attached to a government-owned transportation company. That said, additional organizations in Europe are believed to have been victimized by the actor as well.</p>\n<p>Although no links have been unearthed between the Owowa operators and other publicly documented hacking groups, a username \"S3crt\" (read \"secret\") that was found embedded in the source code of the identified samples has yielded additional malware executables that are likely the work of the same developer. Chief among them are a number of binaries designed to execute an embedded shellcode, load next-stage malware retrieved from a remote server, and trigger the execution of Cobalt Strike payloads.</p>\n\n<p>Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) also said it identified an account with the same username on Keybase, where the individual has shared offensive tools such as Cobalt Strike and Core Impact, in addition to demonstrating an interest in the latter on RAIDForums.</p>\n<p>\"IIS modules are not a common format for backdoors, especially when compared to typical web application threats like web shells and can therefore easily be missed during standard file monitoring efforts,\" Rascagneres and Delcher said. \"The malicious module [\u2026] represents an effective option for attackers to gain a strong foothold in targeted networks by persisting inside an Exchange server.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>As a CISO, one of the most challenging questions to answer is \"How well are we protected right now?\" Between the acceleration of hackers' offensive capabilities and the dynamic nature of information networks, a drift in the security posture is unavoidable and needs to be continuously compensated. Therefore, answering that question implies continuously validating the security posture and being in a position to check it including, against the latest emerging threats.</p>\n<p>Yet, the bulk of cybersecurity is focused on defensive tools. The combination of the rapid evolution of technology and the multiplication of technology layers, combined with the professionalization of the threat landscape, has led to a profusion of cybersecurity tools tackling different security aspects.</p>\n<p>Checking the cybersecurity solution stack efficiency is typically done through pen-testing or, more recently, through red teaming \u2013 an exercise aimed to map possible loopholes that would lead to a data breach. When performed once or twice a year only, these tests might satisfy the compliance regulators. Still, as new threats emerge daily, they fail to inform about the environment's current security posture effectively.</p>\n<p>In addition, these infrequent tests fail to inform about potential tool overlaps and are not designed to prevent tool sprawl, a frequent occurrence in a field where <a href=\"https://newsroom.trendmicro.com/2021-10-12-Cybersecurity-Tool-Sprawl-Drives-Plans-to-Outsource-Detection-and-Response#assets_all\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">over half of SOC centers are overrun with redundant security tools</a> and are swamped by too many alerts.</p>\n<p>Unrationalized security stacks are not only unnecessarily costly, but they also generate more false-positive calls, needlessly taxing security staff stamina and increasing the risk of missing a critical alert.</p>\n<p>The ability to measure each tool's efficacy, eliminate overlap and maintain continuous control over security baseline variability relies on continuous access to quantified data. This is at the core of what Extended Security Posture Management (XPSM) brings to the table.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Understanding Extended Security Posture Management</strong></h2>\n<p>Extended Security Posture Management (XSPM) is a multilayered process combining the capabilities of Attack Surface Management (ASM), Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS), Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART), and Purple Teaming to continuously evaluate and score the infrastructure's overall cyber resiliency. </p>\n<p>This up-to-date comprehensive snapshot of the active security posture, combined with detailed remediation process recommendations, is conducive to making rational business decisions based on hard data. </p>\n<p>Using the granular evaluation of each individual tool and of the security control configuration, an XSPM solution provides granular information about each solution used, the eventual overlap between two or more solutions and the remaining security gaps. It then provides detailed recommendations about the remediation process for each gap and optimization options for identified overlaps.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Advantage of a Consolidated, Extensive Baseline</h2>\n<p>Security teams are systematically impressed by the difference in having actionable data made, both in improving the security posture and in rationalizing cybersecurity spending. </p>\n<p>XSPM helps the security team to deal with the constant content configuration churn and leverages telemetry to help identify the gaps in security by generating up-to-date emerging threats feeds and providing additional test cases emulating TTPs that attackers would use, saving DevSocOps the time needed to develop those test cases. When running XSPM validation modules, knowing that the tests are timely, current, and relevant enables reflecting on the efficacy of security controls and understanding where to make investments to ensure that the configuration, hygiene and posture are maintained through the constant changes in the environment.</p>\n<p>By providing visibility and maximizing relevancy, XSPM helps verify that each dollar spent benefits risk reduction and tool efficacy through baselining and trending and automatically generating reports containing detailed recommendations covering security hardening and tool stack optimization; it dramatically facilitates conversations with the board.</p>\n<p>The switch from infrequent to regular testing, made possible by automation, enables both the continuous baseline variability monitoring and the quantified calculation of ROI achieved through tool stack rationalization.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it enables creating attack-based vulnerability management by leveraging the results to prioritize patching.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, checking an environment's ability to withstand the latest attacks can be done almost at a click, and, if needed, recommended mitigation processes can be pushed forward in the prioritized patching schedule.</p>\n<p>George Washington's adage \"<em>The best defense is a good offense</em>\" definitely applies to cybersecurity, and the continuous offense is the only way to stay ahead of the attackers' progress consistently.</p>\n<p>Note: This article was written by Arien Seghetti, Solution Architect at <a href=\"https://cymulate.com/?utm_source=PaidPR&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNews_Q4-2021_XSPM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cymulate</a>. <em>For more information, visit </em><a href=\"https://cymulate.com/?utm_source=PaidPR&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNews_Q4-2021_XSPM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>www.cymulate.com</em></a><em> and register for a </em><a href=\"https://cymulate.com/free-trial/?utm_source=PaidPR&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNews_Q4-2021_XSPM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Free Trial</em></a><em>.</em> </p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It is a prevalent information-stealing malware that, in recent years, has become a precursor to many critical and widespread ransomware attacks, offering a malware installation-as-a-service that enables many campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>First discovered in 2007, the modular malware \u2014 like <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/140000-reasons-why-emotet-is.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TrickBot</a> \u2014 has <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/08/qakbot-banking-trojan.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evolved</a> from its early roots as a banking trojan to become a Swiss Army knife capable of data exfiltration and acting as a delivery mechanism for the second stage payloads, including ransomware. Also notable is its tactic of hijacking victims' legitimate email threads from Outlook clients via an Email Collector component and using those threads as phishing lures to infect other machines.</p>\n\n<p>\"Compromising IMAP services and email service providers (ESPs), or hijacking email threads allows attackers to leverage the trust a potential victim has in people they have corresponded with before, and it also allows for the impersonation of a compromised organization,\" Trend Micro researchers Ian Kenefick and Vladimir Kropotov <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/qakbot-loader-returns-with-new-techniques-and-tools.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">detailed</a> last month. \"Indeed, intended targets will be much more likely to open emails from a recognized sender.\"</p>\n<p>Qakbot activity tracked by the cybersecurity firm over a seven month period between March 25, 2021, and October 25, 2021, show that the U.S., Japan, Germany, India, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea, Turkey, Spain, and France are the top targeted countries, with the intrusions primarily striking telecommunications, technology, and education sectors.</p>\n<p>More recently, spam campaigns have resulted in the deployment of a new loader called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/hackers-using-squirrelwaffle-loader-to.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SQUIRRELWAFFLE</a> that enables the attackers to gain an initial foothold into enterprise networks and drop malicious payloads, such as Qakbot and Cobalt Strike, on infected systems.</p>\n\n<p>Now according to Microsoft, attack chains involving Qakbot comprise of several building blocks that chart the various stages of the compromise, right from the methods adopted to distribute the malware \u2014 links, attachments, or <a href=\"https://www.inky.com/blog/urgency-mail-relay-serve-phishers-well-on-craigslist\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">embedded images</a> \u2014 before carrying out an array of post-exploitation activities such as credential theft, email exfiltration, lateral movement, and the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons and ransomware.</p>\n<p>The Redmond-based company noted that Qakbot-related emails sent by the attackers may, at times, come with a ZIP archive file attachment that includes a spreadsheet containing <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybercriminals-widely-abusing-excel-40.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Excel 4.0 macros</a>, an initial access vector that's widely abused in phishing attacks. Regardless of the mechanism employed to deliver the malware, the campaigns have in common their use of malicious Excel 4.0 macros.</p>\n\n<p>While macros are turned off by default in Microsoft Office, recipients of the email messages are prompted to enable the macro to view the document's actual content. This triggers the next phase of the onslaught to download the malicious payloads from one or more attacker-controlled domains.</p>\n<p>More often than not, Qakbot is just the first step in what's part of a larger attack, with the threat actors using the initial foothold facilitated by the malware to install additional payloads or sell the access to the highest bidder on underground forums who can then leverage it for their own ends. In June 2021, enterprise security company Proofpoint <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/ransomware-attackers-partnering-with.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> how ransomware actors are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major entities.</p>\n<p>\"Qakbot's modularity and flexibility could pose a challenge for security analysts and defenders because concurrent Qakbot campaigns could look strikingly different on each affected device, significantly impacting how these defenders respond to such attacks,\" the researchers said. \"Therefore, a deeper understanding of Qakbot is paramount in building a comprehensive and coordinated defense strategy against it.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The link to the complaint directs the victims to what ostensibly looks like a government website, where they are asked to enter their personal information (e.g., name, phone number, etc.) and download an Android APK file.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the rogue application not only requests for invasive permissions to perform activities that are not generally associated with such government apps, it also presents a fake login screen that mimics Sana, the country's electronic judicial notice system, and prompts the victim that they need to pay a $1 fee to proceed further.</p>\n\n<p>Users opting to do so are then redirected to a fake payment page that collects the credit card information entered, while the installed app functions as a stealthy backdoor to surreptitiously steal one-time passcodes sent by the credit card company and facilitate additional theft.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the malware comes with a wealth of capabilities that allow it to exfiltrate all SMS messages received by a device to an attacker-controlled server, hide its icon from the home screen to thwart attempts to remove the app, deploy additional payloads, and acquire worm-like powers to expand its attack surface and spread custom smishing messages to a list of phone numbers retrieved from the server.</p>\n\n<p>\"This allows the actors to distribute phishing messages from the phone numbers of typical users instead of from a centralized place and not be limited to a small set of phone numbers that could be easily blocked,\" Cohen explained. \"This means that technically, there are no 'malicious' numbers that can be blocked by the telecommunication companies or traced back to the attacker.\"</p>\n<p>Making matters worse, the attackers behind the operation have been found to follow poor operational security (OPSEC), thereby making it possible for any third party to freely access the phone numbers, contacts, SMS messages, and the list of all the online bots hosted on their servers.</p>\n<p>\"Stealing 2FA dynamic codes allows the actors to slowly but steadily withdraw significant amounts of money from the victims' accounts, even in cases when due to the bank limitations each distinct operation might garner only tens of dollars,\" Cohen noted. \"Together with the easy adoption of the 'botnet as a service' business model, it should come as no surprise that the number of such applications for Android and the number of people selling them is growing.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Therefore, the malware operators can control the whole malware family through one set of command and control scripts.\"</p>\n\n<p>Likely active since at least 2012, ScarCruft is known for targeting public and private sectors situated in South Korea with an aim to plunder sensitive information stored in the compromised systems, and has been previously observed using a Windows-based backdoor called <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rokrat\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RokRAT</a>.</p>\n<p>The primary initial infection vector used by APT37 is spear-phishing, in which the actor sends an email to a target that is weaponized with a malicious document. In August 2021, the threat actor was unmasked using two exploits in the Internet Explorer web browser to infect victims with a custom implant known as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/nk-hackers-deploy-browser-exploit-on.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BLUELIGHT</a> by staging a watering hole attack against a South Korean online newspaper.</p>\n\n<p>The case investigated by Kaspersky is both similar and different in some ways. The actor reached out to the victim's associates and acquaintances using stolen Facebook account credentials to establish initial contact, only to follow it up with a spear-phishing email enclosing a password-protected RAR archive that includes a Word document. This decoy document claims to be about \"North Korea's latest situation and our national security.\"</p>\n<p>Opening the Microsoft Office document triggers the execution of a macro and the decryption of the next-stage payload embedded within the document. The payload, a Visual Basic Application (VBA), contains a shellcode that, in turn, retrieves from a remote server the final-stage payload with backdoor capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Additional techniques uncovered by GReAT on one of the infected victims show that post its breach on March 22, 2021, the operators managed to collect screenshots for a period of two months between August and September, before deploying a fully-featured malware called Chinotto in late August to control the device and exfiltrate sensitive information to a command-and-control (C2) server.</p>\n\n<p>What's more, Chinotto comes with its own Android variant to achieve the same goal of spying on its users. The malicious APK file, delivered to the recipients via a smishing attack, prompts users to grant it a wide range of permissions during the installation phase, enabling the app to amass contact lists, messages, call logs, device information, audio recordings, and data stored in apps such as Huawei Drive, Tencent WeChat (aka Weixin), and KakaoTalk.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky said it worked with South Korea's emergency response teams to take down ScarCruft's attack infrastructure, adding it traced the roots of Chinotto in <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.poorweb\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PoorWeb</a>, a backdoor previously attributed to use by the APT group.</p>\n<p>\"Many journalists, defectors and human rights activists are targets of sophisticated cyberattacks,\" the researchers said. \"Unlike corporations, these targets typically don't have sufficient tools to protect against and respond to highly skilled surveillance attacks.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The intrusions were also notable for the fact that the malicious shell scripts specifically disabled a process designed to monitor and scan the servers for security issues as well as reset users' passwords to the Elastic cloud service.</p>\n\n<p>Now according to the Chinese internet security company, these shell scripts are being used to spread Abcbot. A total of six versions of the botnet have been observed to date.</p>\n<p>Once installed on a compromised host, the malware triggers the execution of a series of steps that results in the infected device being repurposed as a web server, in addition to reporting the system information to a command-and-control (C2) server, spreading the malware to new devices by scanning for open ports, and self-updating itself as and when new features are made available by its operators.</p>\n\n<p>\"Interesting thing is that the sample [updated] on October 21 uses the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/millken/kdev/tree/master/4atk%201.05new\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ATK Rootkit</a> to implement the DDoS function,\" a mechanism which the researchers said \"requires Abcbot to download the source code, compile, and load the rootkit module before performing [a] DDoS attack.\"</p>\n<p>\"This process requires too many steps, and any step that is faulty will result in the failure of the DDoS function,\" the researchers noted, leading the adversary to replace the off-the-shelf component with a custom attack module in a subsequent version released on October 30 that completely abandons the ATK rootkit.</p>\n\n<p>The findings come a little over a week after the Netlab security team disclosed details of a \"<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/researchers-uncover-pink-botnet-malware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pink</a>\" botnet that's believed to have infected over 1.6 million devices primarily located in China with the goal of launching DDoS attacks and inserting advertisements into HTTP websites visited by unsuspecting users. In a related development, AT&amp;T Alien Labs took the wraps off a new Golang malware dubbed \"<a href=\"https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/att-alien-labs-finds-new-golang-malwarebotenago-targeting-millions-of-routers-and-iot-devices-with-more-than-30-exploits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BotenaGo</a>\" that has been discovered using over thirty exploits to potentially attack millions of routers and IoT devices.</p>\n<p>\"The update process in these six months is not so much a continuous upgrade of features as a trade-off between different technologies,\" the researchers concluded. \"Abcbot is slowly moving from infancy to maturity.

The identities of the targeted entities were not disclosed, nor did the findings link the cluster's activity to a specific country.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, a recent incident investigated by CrowdStrike found the targeted intrusion actor taking advantage of external DNS (eDNS) servers to connect directly to and from other compromised telecom companies' GPRS networks via SSH and through previously established backdoors such as PingPong. The initial compromise is facilitated with the help of password-spraying attacks, consequently leading to the installation of SLAPSTICK malware to steal passwords and pivot to other systems in the network.</p>\n<p>Other indications based on telemetry data show the targeted intrusion actor's ability to emulate GPRS network access points so as to perform command-and-control communications in conjunction with a Unix-based backdoor called TinyShell, thereby enabling the attacker to tunnel traffic through the telecommunications network.</p>\n<p>Among the multiple tools in LightBasin's malware arsenal is a network scanning and packet capture utility called \"CordScan\" that allows the operators to fingerprint mobile devices, as well as \"SIGTRANslator,\" an ELF binary that can transmit and receive data via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGTRAN\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SIGTRAN</a> protocol suite, which is used to carry public switched telephone network (PSTN) signaling over IP networks.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is not surprising that servers would need to communicate with one another as part of roaming agreements between telecommunications companies; however, LightBasin's ability to pivot between multiple telecommunications companies stems from permitting all traffic between these organizations without identifying the protocols that are actually required,\" CrowdStrike noted.</p>\n<p>\"As such, the key recommendation here is for any telecommunications company to ensure that firewalls responsible for the GPRS network have rules in place to restrict network traffic to only those protocols that are expected, such as DNS or GTP,\" the company added.</p>\n<p>The findings also come just as cybersecurity firm Symantec disclosed details of a previously unseen advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed \"<a href=\"https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/harvester-new-apt-attacks-asia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harvester</a>,\" which has been linked to an information-stealing campaign aimed at telecommunications, government, and information technology sectors in South Asia since June 2021 using a custom implant called \"Graphon.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In June 2021, findings from enterprise security company Proofpoint <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/ransomware-attackers-partnering-with.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> that ransomware actors are increasingly shifting from using email messages as an intrusion route to purchasing access from cybercriminal enterprises that have already infiltrated major entities, with Ryuk infections mainly leveraging accesses obtained via malware families like TrickBot and BazaLoader.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of initial access brokers by cybersecurity firm KELA in August 2021 <a href=\"https://ke-la.com/all-access-pass-five-trends-with-initial-access-brokers/\">found</a> that the average cost of network access was $5,400 for the period July 2020 to June 2021, with select actors adopting an ethical stance against trading access to healthcare companies. FIN12's targeting of the healthcare sector suggests that its initial access brokers \"cast a wider net and allow FIN12 actors to choose from a list of victims after accesses are already obtained.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mandiant also noted that it observed, in May 2021, threat actors obtaining a foothold in the network through phishing email campaigns distributed internally from compromised user accounts, before leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon and WEIRDLOOP payloads. Attacks mounted between mid-February and mid-April of 2021 are said to also have taken advantage of remote logins by getting hold of credentials to victims' Citrix environments.</p>\n<p>Although FIN12's tactics in late 2019 involved using TrickBot as a means to maintain a foothold in the network and carry out latter-stage tasks, including reconnaissance, delivering malware droppers, and deploying the ransomware, the group has since consistently banked on Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads for performing post-exploitation activities.</p>\n\n<p>FIN12 also distinguishes itself from other intrusion threat actors in that it rarely engages in data theft extortion \u2014 a tactic that's used to leak exfiltrated data when victims refuse to pay up \u2014 which Mandiant says stems from the threat actor's desire to move quickly and strike targets that are willing to settle with minimal negotiation to recover critical systems, a factor that perhaps explains their increasing interest in attacking healthcare networks.</p>\n<p>\"The average time to ransom (TTR) across our FIN12 engagements involving data theft was 12.4 days (12 days, 9 hours, 44 minutes) compared to 2.48 days (2 days, 11 hours, 37 minutes) where data theft was not observed,\" the researchers said. \"FIN12's apparent success without the need to incorporate additional extortion methods likely reinforces this notion.\"</p>\n<p>\"[FIN12 is the] first FIN actor that we are promoting who specializes in a specific phase of the attack lifecycle \u2014 ransomware deployment \u2014 while relying on other threat actors for gaining initial access to victims,\" Mandiant noted. \"This specialization reflects the current ransomware ecosystem, which is comprised of various loosely affiliated actors partnering together, but not exclusively with one another.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

These binaries are commonly used on Linux systems and can additionally serve as a persistence mechanism.\"</p>\n<p>FontOnLake's toolset includes three components that consist of trojanized versions of legitimate Linux utilities that are used to load kernel-mode rootkits and user-mode backdoors, all of which communicate with one another using virtual files. The C++-based implants themselves are designed to monitor systems, secretly execute commands on networks, and exfiltrate account credentials.</p>\n\n<p>A second permutation of the backdoor also comes with capabilities to act as a proxy, manipulate files, download arbitrary files, while a third variant, besides incorporating features from the other two backdoors, is equipped to execute Python scripts and shell commands.</p>\n<p>ESET said it found two different versions of the Linux rootkit that's based on an open-source project called <a href=\"https://github.com/mncoppola/suterusu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suterusu</a> and share overlaps in functionality, including hiding processes, files, network connections, and itself, while also being able to carry out file operations, and extract and execute the user-mode backdoor.</p>\n\n<p>It's currently not known how the attackers gain initial access to the network, but the cybersecurity company noted that the threat actor behind the attacks is \"overly cautious\" to avoid leaving any tracks by relying on different, unique command-and-control (C2) servers with varying non-standard ports. All the C2 servers observed in the VirusTotal artifacts are no longer active.</p>\n<p>\"Their scale and advanced design suggest that the authors are well versed in cybersecurity and that these tools might be reused in future campaigns,\" Hr\u010dka said. \"As most of the features are designed just to hide its presence, relay communication, and provide backdoor access, we believe that these tools are used mostly to maintain an infrastructure which serves some other, unknown, malicious purposes.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

What's more, the adversary behind the attacks is also said to have deployed an unknown executable named \"lsa.exe\" to perform credential dumping.</p>\n<p>Investigation into the attribution of the cyber-attacks has also yielded an entirely new Iranian threat actor named MalKamak that has been operating since around the same time period and has eluded discovery and analysis thus far, with possible connections to other Iranian state-sponsored APT threat actors such as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/iranian-hackers-sanctioned.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chafer APT</a> (aka APT39) and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/data-wiper-malware-disguised-as.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Agrius APT</a>, the latter of which was found posing as ransomware operators in an effort to conceal the origin of a series of data-wiping hacks against Israeli entities.</p>\n\n<p>Besides carrying out reconnaissance and the exfiltration of sensitive data, ShellClient is engineered as a modular portable executable that's capable of performing fingerprinting and registry operations. Also of note is the RAT's abuse of cloud storage services such as Dropbox for command-and-control (C2) communications in an attempt to stay under the radar by blending in with legitimate network traffic originating from the compromised systems.</p>\n\n<p>The Dropbox storage contains three folders, each storing information about the infected machines, the commands to be executed by the ShellClient RAT, and the results of those commands. \"Every two seconds, the victim machine checks the commands folder, retrieves files that represent commands, parses their content, then deletes them from the remote folder and enables them for execution,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned modus operandi mirrors a tactic adopted by another threat actor called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/indigozebra-apt-hacking-campaign.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IndigoZebra</a>, which was uncovered as relying on Dropbox API to store commands in a victim-specific sub-folder that's retrieved by the malware prior to execution.</p>\n<p>The findings also arrive days after a new advanced persistent threat dubbed \"<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/a-new-apt-hacking-group-targeting-fuel.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ChamelGang</a>\" was identified as behind a string of attacks targeting fuel, energy, and aviation production industries in Russia, the U.S., India, Nepal, Taiwan, and Japan with the goal of stealing data from compromised networks.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Calling the group \"<a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Double Dragon</a>\" for its twin objectives, Mandiant (formerly FireEye) pointed out the collective's penchant for striking healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors for establishing long-term access and facilitating the theft of intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the group is known for staging cybercrime intrusions that are aimed at stealing source code and digital certificates, virtual currency manipulation, and deploying ransomware, as well as executing software supply chain compromises by injecting malicious code into legitimate files prior to distribution of software updates.</p>\n<p>The latest research by BlackBerry builds on previous findings by Mandiant in March 2020, which detailed a \"<a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global intrusion campaign</a>\" unleashed by APT41 by exploiting a number of publicly known vulnerabilities affecting Cisco and Citrix devices to drop and execute next-stage payloads that were subsequently used to download a Cobalt Strike Beacon loader on compromised systems. The loader was notable for its use of a malleable command-and-control (C2) profile that allowed the Beacon to blend its network communications with a remote server into legitimate traffic originating from the victim network.</p>\n<p>BlackBerry, which found a <a href=\"https://github.com/1135/1135-CobaltStrike-ToolKit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar C2 profile</a> uploaded to GitHub on March 29 by a Chinese security researcher with the pseudonym \"1135,\" used the metadata configuration information to identify a fresh cluster of domains related to APT41 that attempt to masquerade Beacon traffic look like legitimate traffic from Microsoft sites, with IP address and domain name overlaps found in campaigns linked to the <a href=\"https://www.prevailion.com/the-gh0st-remains-the-same-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Higaisa APT group</a> and that of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/researchers-disclose-undocumented.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Winnti</a> disclosed over the past year.</p>\n\n<p>A follow-on investigation into the URLs revealed as many as three malicious PDF files that reached out to one of the newly discovered domains that had also previously hosted a Cobalt Strike Team Server. The documents, likely used along phishing emails as an initial infection vector, claimed to be COVID-19 advisories issued by the government of India or contain information regarding the latest income tax legislation targeting non-resident Indians.</p>\n<p>The spear-phishing attachments appear in the form of .LNK files or .ZIP archives, which, when opened, result in the PDF document being displayed to the victim, while, in the background, the infection chain leads to the execution of a Cobalt Strike Beacon. Although a set of intrusions using similar phishing lures and <a href=\"https://www.subexsecure.com/pdf/malware-reports/sept-2020/Evilnum-Infostealer-lurking-in-Indian-cyberspace%20.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uncovered in September 2020</a> were pinned on the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/evilnum-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Evilnum</a> group, BlackBerry said the compromise indicators point to an APT41-affiliated campaign.</p>\n<p>\"With the resources of a nation-state level threat group, it's possible to create a truly staggering level of diversity in their infrastructure,\" the researchers said, adding by piecing together the malicious activities of the threat actor via public sharing of information, it's possible to \"uncover the tracks that the cybercriminals involved worked so hard to hide.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Nobelium is also known by the monikers UNC2452, SolarStorm, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and Iron Ritual.</p>\n\n<p>\"While supply-chain attacks were already a documented attack vector leveraged by a number of APT actors, this specific campaign stood out due to the extreme carefulness of the attackers and the high-profile nature of their victims,\" Kaspersky researchers <a href=\"https://securelist.com/darkhalo-after-solarwinds-the-tomiris-connection/104311/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"Evidence gathered so far indicates that Dark Halo spent six months inside Orion IT's networks to perfect their attack and make sure that their tampering of the build chain wouldn't cause any adverse effects.\"</p>\n<p>Microsoft, which detailed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/researchers-find-3-new-malware-strains.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SUNSHUTTLE</a> in March 2021, described the strain as a Golang-based malware that acts as a command-and-control backdoor, establishing a secure connection with an attacker-controlled server to fetch and execute arbitrary commands on the compromised machine as well as exfiltrate files from the system to the server.</p>\n\n<p>The new Tomiris backdoor, found by Kaspersky in June this year from samples dating back to February, is also written in Go and deployed via a successful DNS hijacking attack during which targets attempting to access the login page of a corporate email service were redirected to a fraudulent domain set up with a lookalike interface designed to trick the visitors into downloading the malware under the guise of a security update.</p>\n<p>The attacks are believed to have been mounted against several government organizations in an unnamed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CIS</a> member state.</p>\n<p>\"The main purpose of the backdoor was to establish a foothold in the attacked system and to download other malicious components,\" the researchers said, in addition to finding a number of similarities ranging from the encryption scheme to the same spelling mistakes that collectively hint at the \"possibility of common authorship or shared development practices.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time overlaps have been discovered between different tools put to use by the threat actor. Earlier this year, Kaspersky's <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/researchers-find-links-between-sunburst.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a> of Sunburst revealed a number of shared features between the malware and Kazuar, a .NET-based backdoor attributed to the Turla group. Interestingly, the cybersecurity company said it detected Tomiris in networks where other machines were infected with Kazuar, adding weight to prospects that the three malware families could be linked to each other.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the researchers pointed out it could also be a case of a false flag attack, wherein threat actors deliberately reproduce the tactics and techniques adopted by a known adversary in an attempt to mislead attribution.</p>\n<p>The revelation comes days after Microsoft took the wraps of a passive and highly targeted implant dubbed <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/microsoft-warns-of-foggyweb-malware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FoggyWeb</a> that was employed by the Nobelium group to deliver additional payloads and steal sensitive information from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

This is also accompanied by a threat to publicly disclose targets' sensitive files in a technique called double extortion.</p>\n<p>\"These payments represent just a fraction of the economic harm caused by cyber-attacks, but they underscore the objectives of those who seek to weaponize technology for personal gain,\" the Treasury Department added.</p>\n\n<p>Officials also emphasized the role of virtual currencies in furthering illicit activity through peer-to-peer exchangers, mixers, and exchanges, not to mention help evade sanctions, carry out ransomware schemes, and conduct other financially motivated cyber crimes, making such technologies ripe for exploitation by bad actors. However, in SUEX's case, it helped facilitate illegal activity \"for their own illicit gains.\"</p>\n\n<p>Besides freezing all property assets of the designated target that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction, U.S. citizens are generally banned from performing transactions with sanctioned entities, and financial institutions that engage in certain activities with them could themselves face sanctions or be subjected to enforcement actions.</p>\n<p>What's more, the U.S.Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> an updated advisory on the potential sanctions risks arising out of settling with ransomware actors, urging victims and related companies to not only refrain from paying ransoms but also \"report these incidents to and fully cooperate with law enforcement as soon as possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shutting down cryptocurrency-based money launderers is one of the most important strategies to combat cryptocurrency-related crime,\" Chainalysis said. \"It all comes down to incentives. If cybercriminals have no way of moving ill-gotten cryptocurrency to services where it can be stored safely or converted into cash, there's much less reason for them to use cryptocurrency in the first place.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Microsoft has since <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/microsoft-releases-patch-for-actively.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rolled out a fix</a> for the vulnerability as part of its Patch Tuesday updates a week later on September 14.</p>\n<p>The Redmond-based tech giant attributed the activities to related cybercriminal clusters it tracks as DEV-0413 and DEV-0365, the latter of which is the company's moniker for the emerging threat group associated with creating and managing the Cobalt Strike infrastructure used in the attacks. The earliest exploitation attempt by DEV-0413 dates back to August 18.</p>\n<p>The exploit delivery mechanism originates from emails impersonating contracts and legal agreements hosted on file-sharing sites. Opening the malware-laced document leads to the download of a Cabinet archive file containing a DLL bearing an INF file extension that, when decompressed, leads to the execution of a function within that DLL. The DLL, in turn, retrieves remotely hosted shellcode \u2014 a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader \u2014 and loads it into the Microsoft address import tool.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Microsoft said some of the infrastructures that were used by DEV-0413 to host the malicious artifacts were also involved in the delivery of BazaLoader and Trickbot payloads, a separate set of activities the company monitors under the codename DEV-0193 (and by Mandiant as UNC1878).</p>\n<p>\"At least one organization that was successfully compromised by DEV-0413 in their August campaign was previously compromised by a wave of similarly-themed malware that interacted with DEV-0365 infrastructure almost two months before the CVE-2021-40444 attack,\" the researchers said. \"It is currently not known whether the retargeting of this organization was intentional, but it reinforces the connection between DEV-0413 and DEV-0365 beyond sharing of infrastructure.\"</p>\n<p>In an independent investigation, Microsoft's RiskIQ subsidiary attributed the attacks with high confidence to a ransomware syndicate known as Wizard Spider aka Ryuk, noting that the network infrastructure employed to provide command-and-control to the Cobalt Strike Beacon implants spanned more than 200 active servers.</p>\n<p>\"The association of a zero-day exploit with a ransomware group, however remote, is troubling,\" RiskIQ researchers <a href=\"https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/wizard-spider-windows-0day-exploit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. It suggests either that turnkey tools like zero-day exploits have found their way into the already robust ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem or that the more operationally sophisticated groups engaged in traditional, government-backed espionage are using criminally controlled infrastructure to misdirect and impede attribution.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Intezer also called out the espionage campaign's limited scope, noting the malware's use in specific attacks as opposed to large-scale intrusions, while also attributing it to a \"skilled threat actor\" owing to the fact that Vermilion Strike has not been observed in other attacks to date.</p>\n<p>This is far from the first time the legitimate security testing toolkit has been used to orchestrate attacks against a wide range of targets.

The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights,\" it added.</p>\n<p>The Windows maker credited researchers from EXPMON and Mandiant for reporting the flaw, although the company did not disclose additional specifics about the nature of the attacks, the identity of the adversaries exploiting this zero-day, or their targets in light of real-world attacks.</p>\n<p>EXPMON, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EXPMON_/status/1435309115883020296\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweet</a>, noted it found the vulnerability after detecting a \"highly sophisticated zero-day attack\" aimed at Microsoft Office users, adding it passed on its findings to Microsoft on Sunday. \"The exploit uses logical flaws so the exploitation is perfectly reliable (&amp; dangerous),\" EXPMON researchers said.</p>\n\n<p>However, it's worth pointing out that the current attack can be suppressed if Microsoft Office is run with default configurations, wherein documents downloaded from the web are opened in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Protected View</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/install-app-guard?view=o365-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Application Guard for Office</a>, which is designed to prevent untrusted files from accessing trusted resources in the compromised system.</p>\n<p>Microsoft, upon completion of the investigation, is expected to either release a security update as part of its Patch Tuesday monthly release cycle or issue an out-of-band patch \"depending on customer needs.\" In the interim, the Windows maker is urging users and organizations to disable all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to mitigate any potential attack.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

This typically occurs when the response from the vulnerable service is larger than the spoofed request, which can then be leveraged to send thousands of these requests, thereby significantly amplifying the size and bandwidth issued to the target.</p>\n\n<p>While DoS amplifications are traditionally UDP-based owing to complications arising out of TCP's <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three-way handshake</a> to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP based network (SYN, SYN+ACK, and ACK), the researchers found that a large number of network middleboxes do not conform to the TCP standard, and that they can \"respond to spoofed censored requests with large block pages, even if there is no valid TCP connection or handshake,\" turning the devices into attractive targets for DoS amplification attacks.</p>\n<p>\"Middleboxes are often not TCP-compliant by design: many middleboxes attempt [to] handle asymmetric routing, where the middlebox can only see one direction of packets in a connection (e.g., client to server),\" the researchers <a href=\"https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/posts/usenix21-weaponizing-censors/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"But this feature opens them to attack: if middleboxes inject content based only on one side of the connection, an attacker can spoof one side of a TCP three-way handshake, and convince the middlebox there is a valid connection.\"</p>\n<p>Put differently, the mechanism hinges on tricking the middlebox into injecting a response without completing the three-way handshake, subsequently using it to access a forbidden domain such as pornography, gambling, and file sharing sites, causing the middlebox to respond with a block page, which would be much larger than the censored requests, thus resulting in an amplification.</p>\n\n<p>What's more, not only do these amplified responses come predominantly from middleboxes, a chunk of those network inspection equipment are nation-state censorship apparatus, highlighting the role played by such infrastructure in enabling governments to suppress access to the information within their borders, and worse, allow adversaries to weaponize the networking devices to attack any victim on the internet.</p>\n<p>\"Nation-state censorship infrastructure is located at high-speed ISPs, and is capable of sending and injecting data at incredibly high bandwidths,\" the researchers said. \"This allows an attacker to amplify larger amounts of traffic without worry of amplifier saturation. Second, the enormous pool of source IP addresses that can be used to trigger amplification attacks makes it difficult for victims to simply block a handful of reflectors. Nation-state censors effectively turn every routable IP addresses (sic) within their country into a potential amplifier.\"</p>\n<p>\"Middleboxes introduce an unexpected, as-yet untapped threat that attackers could leverage to launch powerful DoS attacks,\" the researchers <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21fall-bock.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added</a>. \"Protecting the Internet from these threats will require concerted effort from many middlebox manufacturers and operators.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Put differently, the intrusions are simultaneously wide-ranging and narrow-focused, enabling the threat acor to siphon intelligence from high-profile targets.</p>\n\n<p>The infection vector used in the campaign involves sending a spear-phishing email to the victim containing a Dropbox download link that, when clicked, leads to a RAR archive that's designed to mimic a Word document. The archive file, for its part, comes with two malicious DLL libraries (\"version.dll\" and \"wwlib.dll\") and two corresponding executable files that run the malware.</p>\n<p>Upon successfully gaining a foothold, an alternative infection chain observed by Kaspersky leverages removable USB drives to propagate the malware to other hosts with the help of \"version.dll\". On the other hand, the purpose of \"wwlib.dll\" is to download a Cobalt Strike beacon on the compromised Windows system from a remote attacker-controlled domain.</p>\n\n<p>In some instances, the attacks incorporated an extra step wherein the threat actor deployed a post-exploitation tool in the form of a signed-but-rogue version of Zoom video conferencing app, using it to hoover sensitive files to a command-and-control server. A valid digital certificate was used to sign the software in an effort to pass off the tool as benign. Also spotted on some infected machines was a second post-exploitation utility that steals cookies from Google Chrome browser.</p>\n\n<p>LuminousMoth's malicious cyber operations and its possible ties to Mustang Panda APT may also be an attempt to shift tactics and update their defensive measures by re-tooling and developing new and unknown malware implants, Kaspersky noted, thus potentially obscuring any ties to their past activities and blurring their attribution to known groups.</p>\n<p>\"APT actors are known for the frequently targeted nature of their attacks. Typically, they will handpick a set of targets that in turn are handled with almost surgical precision, with infection vectors, malicious implants and payloads being tailored to the victims' identities or environment,\" Kaspersky researchers said.</p>\n<p>\"It's not often we observe a large-scale attack conducted by actors fitting this profile, usually due to such attacks being noisy, and thus putting the underlying operation at risk of being compromised by security products or researchers.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In late May, REvil also masterminded the attack on the world's largest meat producer JBS, which ended up <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/beef-supplier-jbs-paid-hackers-11.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paying $11 million</a> to the extortionists to recover from the incident.</p>\n\n<p>The outage also coincides with U.S. President Joe Biden's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-president-vladimir-putin-of-russia-2/\">phone call</a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, pressing the latter to take steps to disrupt ransomware groups operating in the country, while warning of retaliatory action to defend critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\"The situation is still unfolding, but evidence suggests REvil has suffered a planned, concurrent takedown of their infrastructure, either by the operators themselves or via industry or law enforcement action,\" FireEye Mandiant's John Hultquist <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/multiple-revil-ransomware-sites-are-down-on-the-darkweb-.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> CNBC.</p>\n<p>It appears that REvil's Happy Blog was taken offline around 1 AM EST on Tuesday, with vx-underground <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1414936692516171779\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noting</a> that the group's public-facing representative, Unknown, has not posted on popular hacking forums such as Exploit and XSS since July 8.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, a representative for LockBit ransomware <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1415081002326806538\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1415062414702354433\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XSS Russian-speaking hacking forum</a> that REvil's attack infrastructure received a government legal request, causing the servers to be dismantled. \"REvil is banned from XSS,\" vx-underground <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1415056492185669634\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">later added</a>.</p>\n<p>It's not uncommon for ransomware groups to go under the ground following highly publicized incidents. After the DarkSide gang targeted Colonial Pipeline in May, the operators <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/us-pipeline-ransomware-attackers-go.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> plans to wind up its RaaS affiliate program for good, claiming that its servers had been seized by an unknown law enforcement agency, raising questions as to whether the group actually retired, or rebranded under a new name.</p>\n\n<p>This theory was validated a few weeks later when the U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/us-recovers-23-million-ransom-paid-to.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> last month that it was able to recover most of the money paid by Colonial Pipeline to the DarkSide group through an analysis of the bitcoin trails.</p>\n<p>REvil's unexplained shutdown, in a similar fashion, may as well be a case of planned retirement, or a temporary setback, forcing it to seemingly disband only to eventually reassemble under a new identity so as to attract less attention, or a consequence of increased international scrutiny in the wake of the global ransomware crisis.</p>\n<p>If it indeed turns out that the group has permanently shuttered operations, the move is bound to leave the group's targets in the lurch, with no viable means to negotiate ransoms and get hold of the decryption keys necessary to regain control of their systems, thus permanently locking them out of their data.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what this means, but regardless, I'm happy!\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likethecoins/status/1414939241671532547\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> Katie Nickels, director of intelligence at Red Canary. \"If it's a government takedown - awesome, they're taking action.

Extracting the archive reveals a malware dropper that decodes and injects Bandook into an Internet Explorer process.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the latest variant of Bandook analyzed by ESET contains 132 commands, up from the 120 commands reported by Check Point, implying that the criminal group behind the malware are advancing their malicious tools with improved capabilities and striking power.</p>\n<p>\"Especially interesting is the ChromeInject functionality,\" said ESET researcher Fernando Tavella. \"When the communication with the attacker's command and control server is established, the payload downloads a DLL file, which has an exported method that creates a malicious Chrome extension. The malicious extension tries to retrieve any credentials that the victim submits to a URL. These credentials are stored in Chrome's local storage.\"</p>\n\n<p>Some of the main commands that the payload is capable of processing include listing directory contents, manipulating files, taking screenshots, controlling the cursor on the victim's machine, installing malicious DLLs, terminating running processes, downloading files from a specific URL, exfiltrating the results of the operations to a remote server, and even uninstalling itself from the infected machines.</p>\n<p>If anything, the development is yet another sign that adversaries can still leverage old crimeware solutions to facilitate attacks.</p>\n<p>\"[Bandook's] involvement in different espionage campaigns [...] shows us that it is still a relevant tool for cybercriminals,\" the researchers opined. \"Also, if we consider the modifications made to the malware over the years, it shows us the interest of cybercriminals to keep using this piece of malware in malicious campaigns, making it more sophisticated and more difficult to detect.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>Organizations today already have an overwhelming number of dangers and threats to look out for, from spam to phishing attempts to new infiltration and ransomware tactics. There is no chance to rest, since attack groups are constantly looking for more effective means of infiltrating and infecting systems.</p>\n<p>Today, there are hundreds of groups devoted to infiltrating almost every industry, constantly devising more sophisticated methods to attack organizations.</p>\n<p>It's even more troubling to note that some groups have started to collaborate, creating complex and stealthy tactics that leave even the best security teams scrambling to respond. Such is the case noted by XDR Provider Cynet, as the company observes in its newest Research Webinar (<a href=\"https://info.cynet.com/how-cyber-attack-groups-are-spinning-a-larger-ransomware-web/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register here</a>).</p>\n<p>Cynet's research team noted that two of the most infamous attack groups \u2013 Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider \u2013 have started working together to infect organizations with ransomware.</p>\n<p>The development is certainly troubling, and the report shows why security teams and professionals must constantly be looking at the whole picture, not just the result of an attack. </p>\n<h2>Combining attacks for greater impact </h2>\n<p>Cynet's researchers first noticed something was amiss as they were studying IcedID malware, developed by Lunar Spider. Originally observed in the wild in 2017, IcedID is a banking Trojan that has targeted the financial sectors in both the US and Europe. After it was initially revealed, Lunar Spider shifted IcedID's modus operandi to enable it to deploy additional payloads, such as Cobalt Strike. </p>\n<p>The researchers also studied the CONTI ransomware, a relatively new attack approach developed by Wizard Spider that's already in the FBI's crosshairs. This \"ransomware-as-a-service\" (RaaS) has been spotted in the US and Europe and has already wreaked havoc on many organizations and networks. </p>\n<p>Cynet first suspected the connection between the two organizations as it was exploring a case of CONTI ransomware that used many familiar tactics, though not ones traditionally deployed by the Wizard Spider group. </p>\n<p>During the investigation, the team discovered that CONTI was being deployed through malware campaigns that used IcedID as an initial point of attack. After establishing persistence on targets' devices, IcedID deployed a CONTI ransomware variant to lock the network. </p>\n<h2>Understanding the risks </h2>\n<p>The new Cynet Research Webinar will dive deeper into the anatomy of this collaboration to explain why it's so troubling, but also how it can be detected and combatted. The webinar will discuss: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The background of the attack groups</strong>. Both Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider are well known and highly dangerous. Their existing malware and other tools are widely popular and present in many notable breaches and attacks. Before exploring their tools, the webinar will break down each group. </li>\n<li><strong>The increasing popularity of ransomware attacks. </strong>These tactics have become widespread and are expected to cost organizations hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade. To truly comprehend how to combat this new attack tactic, it's worth establishing how ransomware works, and some common tactics. </li>\n<li><strong>The anatomy of a combined IcedID and CONTI attack</strong>. The webinar will break down a case study of this new attack tactic. Unlike some other ransomware attacks, this new method uses techniques from both to create persistence, avoid detection, and lock systems before organizations can react. Moreover, they're increasingly using \"double extortion\" methods, which both lock data and threaten leaks if payment isn't received. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://info.cynet.com/how-cyber-attack-groups-are-spinning-a-larger-ransomware-web/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register to the webinar here</a>. </p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

One of the discovered artifacts also includes a backdoored version of Psiphon; an open-source VPN tool often used to evade internet censorship.</p>\n<p>Another recent variant involves a plain downloader that retrieves an executable from a hardcoded domain, with the researchers noting that the \"use of this sample diverges from those used by the group in the past, where the payload was dropped by the malware itself, suggesting that the group might be in the process of changing some of its TTPs.\"</p>\n\n<p>What's more, the command-and-control infrastructure is also said to have hosted Android applications in the form of DEX and APK files, raising the possibility that the threat actor is also simultaneously developing malware aimed at mobile users.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the tactics adopted by the adversary overlap with other groups that operate against similar targets, such as Domestic Kitten and Rampant Kitten, with Kaspersky finding parallels in the way the actor used the same set of C2 servers over extended periods of time and attempted to gather information from KeePass password manager.</p>\n<p>\"Ferocious Kitten is an example of an actor that operates in a wider ecosystem intended to track individuals in Iran,\" the researchers concluded. \"Such threat groups do not appear to be covered that often and can therefore get away with casually reusing infrastructure and toolsets without worrying about them being taken down or flagged by security solutions.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Victims of the attack are in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Designated as part of the Lazarus constellation, Andariel is known for unleashing attacks on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically tailored methods created for maximum effectivity. In September 2019, the sub-group, along with Lazarus and Bluenoroff, was <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/us-sanctions-3-north-korean-hacking-groups-behind-sony-and-wannacry-attacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department</a> for their malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Andariel is believed to have been active since at least May 2016.</p>\n\n<p>North Korea has been behind an <a href=\"https://blog.lexfo.fr/Lexfo-WhitePaper-The_Lazarus_Constellation.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly orchestrated effort</a> aimed at infiltrating computers of financial institutions in South Korea and around the world as well as staging <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/us-charges-3-north-korean-hackers-over.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency heists</a> to fund the cash-strapped country in an attempt to circumvent the stranglehold of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">economic sanctions</a> imposed to stop the development of its nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>The findings from Kaspersky build upon a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/lazarus-apt-hackers-are-now-using-bmp.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous report from Malwarebytes</a> in April 2021, which documented a novel infection chain that distributed phishing emails weaponized with a macro embedded in a Word file that's executed upon opening in order to deploy malicious code concealed in the form of a bitmap (.BMP) image file to drop a remote access trojan (RAT) on targeted systems.</p>\n<p>According to the latest analysis, the threat actor, besides installing a backdoor, is also said to have delivered file-encrypting ransomware to one of its victims, implying a financial motive to the attacks. It's worth noting that Andariel has a track record of attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or sell customer information on the black market.</p>\n\n<p>\"This ransomware sample is custom made and specifically developed by the threat actor behind this attack,\" Kaspersky Senior Security Researcher Seongsu Park said. \"This ransomware is controlled by command line parameters and can either retrieve an encryption key from the C2 [server] or, alternatively, as an argument at launch time.\"</p>\n<p>The ransomware is designed to encrypt all files in the machine with the exception of system-critical \".exe,\" \".dll,\" \".sys,\" \".msiins,\" and \".drv\" extensions in return for paying a bitcoin ransom to gain access to a decrypt tool and unique key to unlock the scrambled files.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky's attribution to Andariel stems from overlaps in the XOR-based decryption routine that have been incorporated into the group's tactics as early as 2018 and in the post-exploitation commands executed on victim machines.</p>\n<p>\"The Andariel group has continued to focus on targets in South Korea, but their tools and techniques have evolved considerably,\" Park said. \"The Andariel group intended to spread ransomware through this attack and, by doing so, they have underlined their place as a financially motivated state-sponsored actor.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

down the legacy VPN profile, Blunt said extra layers of protection have been implemented across the enterprise to bolster its cyber defenses. \"But criminal gangs and nation states are always

Malwarebytes, however, noted that there is no evidence of active targeting or compromise by the adversary.</p>\n\n<p>The development is only the latest in a series of surveillance efforts aimed at South Korea. Believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean regime, Kimsuky (aka Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee, and Thallium) has a track record of singling out South Korean entities while expanding their victimology to the U.S., Russia, and various nations in Europe.</p>\n<p>Last November, the adversary was linked to a new modular spyware suite called \"<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/11/new-kimsuky-module-makes-north-korean.html\">KGH_SPY</a>,\" which allows it to carry out reconnaissance of target networks, log keystrokes, and steal confidential information, as well as a stealthy malware under the name \"CSPY Downloader\" that's designed to thwart analysis and download additional payloads.</p>\n\n<p>Kimsuky's attack infrastructure consists of various phishing websites that mimic well known websites such as Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Telegram with an aim to trick victims into entering their credentials. \"This is one of the main methods used by this actor to collect email addresses that later will be used to send spear-phishing emails,\" Malwarebytes researcher Hossein Jazi said.</p>\n<p>In using social engineering as a core component of its operations, the goal is to distribute a malware dropper that takes the form of a ZIP archive file attached to the emails, which ultimately leads to the deployment of an encoded DLL payload called <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.appleseed\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AppleSeed</a>, a backdoor that's been put to use by Kimsuky <a href=\"https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference_slides/2019/VB2019-Kim.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as early as 2019</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Besides using the AppleSeed backdoor to target Windows users, the actor also has used an Android backdoor to target Android users,\" Jazi noted. \"The Android backdoor can be considered as the mobile variant of the AppleSeed backdoor. It uses the same command patterns as the Windows one. Also, both Android and Windows backdoors have used the same infrastructure.\"</p>\n<p>AppleSeed has all the hallmarks of a typical backdoor, with myriad capabilities to record keystrokes, capture screenshots, collect documents with specific extensions (.txt, .ppt, .hwp, .pdf, and .doc), and gather data from removable media devices connected to the machine, all of which are then uploaded to a remote command-and-control server.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most interesting discovery of all is that the threat actor calls themselves Thallium in the malware source code, which is the moniker <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/12/30/microsoft-court-action-against-nation-state-cybercrime/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">assigned by Microsoft</a> based on its tradition of naming nation-state hacking groups after chemical elements.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Distances greater than two are conceivable.\"</p>\n<p>Rowhammer attacks are similar to <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-spectre-flaws-in-intel-and-amd-cpus.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speculative execution</a> in that both break the fundamental security guarantees made by the underlying hardware. Discovered in 2014, Rowhammer refers to a class of DRAM vulnerabilities whereby repeated accesses to a memory row (\"aggressor\") can induce an electrical disturbance big enough to flip bits stored in an adjacent row (\"victim\"), thereby allowing untrusted code to escape its sandbox and take over control of the system.</p>\n\n<p>\"[The attack] works because DRAM cells have been getting smaller and closer together,\" Google Project Zero researchers <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html\">elaborated</a> in 2015. \"As DRAM manufacturing scales down chip features to smaller physical dimensions, to fit more memory capacity onto a chip, it has become harder to prevent DRAM cells from interacting electrically with each other. As a result, accessing one location in memory can disturb neighbouring locations, causing charge to leak into or out of neighbouring cells.\"</p>\n<p>While DRAM manufacturers deployed countermeasures like Target Row Refresh (TRR) to thwart such attacks, the mitigations have been limited to two immediate neighbors of an aggressor row, thus excluding memory cells at a two-row distance. The imperfect protections meant TRR defenses in DDR4 cards could be circumvented to stage new variants of Rowhammer attacks such as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/rowhammer-vulnerability-ddr4-dram.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TRRespass</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-javascript-exploit-can-now-carry.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SMASH</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The distance-two assisted Rowhammer \u2014 aka Half-Double \u2014 now joins that list. \"Given three consecutive rows A, B, and C, we were able to attack C by directing a very large number of accesses to A, along with just a handful (~dozens) to B,\" the researchers explained. In this new setup, A is the \"far aggressor,\" B is the \"near aggressor,\" and C is the \"victim.\"</p>\n<p>Google said it's currently working with the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), an independent standardization body and semiconductor engineering trade organization, along with other industry partners, to identify possible solutions for Rowhammer exploits.</p>\n<p>\"To evaluate the effectiveness of a [SoC-level] mitigation, a DRAM vendor should test a mix of hammering distances rather than only testing at individual distances,\" the researchers <a href=\"https://github.com/google/hammer-kit/blob/main/20210525_half_double.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"In other words, hammering a single row or a pair of sandwiching rows on the raw medium will not show this effect. Instead, pairs of rows on one or both sides of an intended victim need to be hammered.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In a similar vein, a third rogue domain registered by the attackers impersonates an Indian think tank called Center For Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS).</p>\n\n<p>\"Transparent Tribe relies heavily on the use of maldocs to spread their Windows implants,\" the researchers said. \"While CrimsonRAT remains the group's staple Windows implant, their development and distribution of ObliqueRAT in early 2020 indicates they are rapidly expanding their Windows malware arsenal.\"</p>\n<p>In expanding its victimology, switching up its malware arsenal, and designing convincing lures, the threat actor has exhibited a clear willingness to lend its operations a veneer of legitimacy in hopes that doing so would increase the likelihood of success.</p>\n<p>\"Transparent Tribe's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have remained largely unchanged since 2020, but the group continues to implement new lures into its operational toolkit,\" the researchers said. \"The variety of maldoc lures Transparent Tribe employs indicates the group still relies on social engineering as a core component of its operations.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The cyberattack forced the company to shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipeline from the Texas city of Houston to New York harbor, raising concerns about the vulnerability of the U.S. energy infrastructure to cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>\"Colonial Pipeline is continuing to work in partnership with third-party cybersecurity experts, law enforcement, and other federal agencies to restore pipeline operations quickly and safely,\" Colonial Pipeline <a href=\"https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a statement. \"While this situation remains fluid and continues to evolve, the Colonial operations team is executing a plan that involves an incremental process that will facilitate a return to service in a phased approach.\"</p>\n\n<p>While the U.S. government on Monday <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-hes-ready-take-action-if-needed-after-pipeline-attack-2021-05-10/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> there was no evidence to imply that Russia was involved in the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the operators of the DarkSide ransomware issued a statement on their dark web extortion site, pledging it intends to vet the companies its affiliates are targeting going forward to \"avoid social consequences in the future.\"</p>\n<p>\"We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for other our motives,\" the cybercrime gang said, adding, \"Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society.\"</p>\n<h3>DarkSide as Carbon Spider's Ransomware campaign</h3>\n<p>The adversary, which is alleged to have leaked data pertaining to at least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1391744217513304067/\">91 organizations</a> since commencing operations in August 2020, functions as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme, in which partners are roped in to expand the criminal enterprise by breaching corporate networks and deploying the ransomware, while the core developers take charge of maintaining the malware and payment infrastructure. Affiliates typically receive 60% to 70% of the proceeds, and the developers earn the rest.</p>\n<p>Among the victims whose internal data was published on the DarkSide's data leak site are other oil and gas companies such as Forbes Energy Services and Gyrodata, both of which are based in Texas. According to <a href=\"https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/adversary/carbon-spider/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crowdstrike</a>, DarkSide is believed to be the handiwork of a financially-motivated threat actor called <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/anunak\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Spider</a> (aka Anunak, Carbanak, or FIN7), whose high-level manager and systems administrator was recently <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/sysadmin-of-billion-dollar-hacking.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to 10 years in prison</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>\"The DarkSide group is a relatively new player in the game of ransomware.

The Darkside is known to be part of a trend of ransomware attacks that involve systems the cyber community rarely sees involved in the compromised network, like ESXi servers. This leads to suspicions that ICS network (critical infrastructure systems) were involved.\"</p>\n<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> Following the DarkSide ransomware attack that forced Colonial to stop the flow of fuel through its pipelines over the weekend, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a\">published</a> a new advisory urging business to follow security best practices to prevent disruptions, including implementing robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks; regularly testing manual controls; and ensuring that backups are periodically taken and isolated from network connections.</p>\n<p>\"CISA and the FBI do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors,\" the agency said. \"Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim's files will be recovered.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

All the other victims were located in South Asia.</p>\n\n<p>The first reports of Moriya emerged last November when Kaspersky said it discovered the stealthy implant in the networks of regional inter-governmental organizations in Asia and Africa. Malicious activity associated with the operation is said to have dated back to November 2019, with the rootkit persisting in the victim networks for several months following the initial infection.</p>\n<p>\"This tool was used to control public facing servers in those organizations by establishing a covert channel with a C2 server and passing shell commands and their outputs to the C2,\" the company <a href=\"https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2020/99204/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in its APT trends report for Q3 2020. \"This capability is facilitated using a Windows kernel mode driver.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rootkits</a> are particularly dangerous as they allow attackers to gain high privileges in the system, enabling them to intercept core <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">input/output operations</a> conducted by the underlying operating system and better blend with the landscape, thus making it difficult to trace the attacker's digital footprints.</p>\n<p>Microsoft, for its part, has implemented <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several protections</a> into Windows over the years to prevent successful deployment and execution of rootkits, which makes Moriya all the more noteworthy.</p>\n<p>Bulk of the toolset, apart from the backdoor, consists of both proprietary and well-known pieces of malware such as China Chopper web shell, BOUNCER, Earthworm, and Termite that have been previously used by Chinese-speaking threat actors, giving an insight into the attacker's origins. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attacks also show that the targeted entities fit the victimology pattern associated with Chinese-speaking adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>The revelations come as advanced persistent threats (APTs) continue to ramp up highly-targeted data-stealing missions, while simultaneously going to great lengths to stay under the radar for as long as possible, rebuild their malware arsenal, making them more tailored, complex, and harder to detect.</p>\n<p>\"The TunnelSnake campaign demonstrates the activity of a sophisticated actor that invests significant resources in designing an evasive toolset and infiltrating networks of high-profile organizations,\" Lechtik and Dedola said. \"By leveraging Windows drivers, covert communications channels and proprietary malware, the group behind it maintains a considerable level of stealth.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

While MSDTC isn't configured to run automatically on startup, a <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4ff77ea841544569e9da8aa3990724d1473731e684a162014ad1ad54e8c8cef2/details\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VirusTotal sample</a> submitted in July 2020 was found to install the DLL file into the Windows System directory and start the MSDTC service to achieve persistence, raising the possibility that a separate executable is crucial to installing the malware.</p>\n\n<p>Upon successful execution, Pingback resorts to using the ICMP protocol for its main communication. ICMP is a network layer protocol mainly used for sending error messages and operational information, say, a failure alert when another host becomes unreachable.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, Pingback takes advantage of an Echo request (ICMP message type 8), with the message sequence numbers 1234, 1235, and 1236 denoting the type of information contained in the packet \u2014 1234 being a command or data, and 1235 and 1236 being the acknowledgment for receipt of data on the other end. Some of the commands supported by the malware include the capability to run arbitrary shell commands, download and upload files from and to the attacker's host, and execute malicious payloads on the infected machine.</p>\n<p>An investigation into the malware's initial intrusion route is ongoing.</p>\n<p>\"ICMP tunneling is not new, but this particular sample piqued our interest as a real-world example of malware using this technique to evade detection,\" the researchers said. \"ICMP is useful for diagnostics and performance of IP connections, [but] it can also be misused by malicious actors to scan and map a target's network environment. While we are not suggesting that ICMP should be disabled, we do suggest putting in place monitoring to help detect such covert communications over ICMP.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The orchestrated effort saw at least 700 servers associated with the botnet's infrastructure neutered from the inside, thus preventing further exploitation.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., U.K., France, Lithuania, Canada, and Ukraine were involved in the international action.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, the Dutch police, which seized two central servers located in the country, said it had deployed a software update to counter the threat posed by Emotet effectively. \"All infected computer systems will automatically retrieve the update there, after which the Emotet infection will be quarantined,\" the agency noted back in January.</p>\n\n<p>This involved pushing a 32-bit payload named \"<a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2021/01/cleaning-up-after-emotet-the-law-enforcement-file/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EmotetLoader.dll</a>\" via the same channels that were used to distribute the original Emotet to all compromised machines. The cleanup routine, which was set to trigger itself automatically on April 25, 2021, worked by removing the malware from the device, in addition to deleting the autorun Registry key and terminating the process.</p>\n<p>Now on Sunday, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MBThreatIntel/status/1386413655659479043\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that its Emotet-infected machine that had received the specially-crafted time bomb code had successfully initiated the uninstallation routine and removed itself from the Windows system.</p>\n\n<p>As of writing, Abuse.ch's Feodo Tracker shows <a href=\"https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">none of the Emotet servers are online</a>. However, it remains to be seen if this \"final\" blow to the botnet will cause it to bounce back in the future or render it permanently inoperable, paving the way for other cybercrime actors to fill the void.</p><p>\"Historically, Emotet's operators used long breaks in activity to improve their malware,\" Redscan researchers <a href=\"https://www.redscan.com/news/rise-and-fall-emotet-botnet/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> on Friday. \"This means there is a realistic possibility that Emotet's operators will use this opportunity to make the loader malware even more resilient, for example, by using polymorphic techniques to counter future coordinated action. They could also use the Emotet source code to branch off and create smaller, independent botnets.\"</p>\n<p>The mass action marks the second time law enforcement agencies have intervened to remove malware from compromised machines. </p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. government took steps to <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/nsa-discovers-new-vulnerabilities.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remove web shell backdoors</a> dropped by the Hafnium threat actor from Microsoft Exchange servers located in the country that were breached using ProxyLogon exploits.</p>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">court-authorized operation</a>, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it's in the process of notifying all the organizations from which it had removed web shells, implying the intelligence agency accessed the systems without their knowledge.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The other set of attacks went after users in the Palestinian territories and Syria and, to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Both the groups appear to have leveraged the platform as a springboard to launch a variety of social engineering attacks in an attempt to lure people into clicking on malicious links and installing malware on their devices. To disrupt the adversary operations, Facebook said it took down their accounts, blocked domains associated with their activity, and alerted users it suspects were singled out by these groups to help them secure their accounts.</p>\n<h3>Android Spyware in Benign-Looking Chat Apps</h3>\n<p>PSS is said to have used custom-built Android malware that was disguised as secure chat applications to stealthily capture device metadata, capture keystrokes, and upload the data to Firebase. In addition, the group deployed another Android malware called SpyNote that came with the ability to monitor calls and remotely access the compromised phones.</p>\n\n<p>This group used fake and compromised accounts to create fictitious personas, often posing as young women, and also as supporters of Hamas, Fatah, various military groups, journalists, and activists with an aim to build relationships with the targets and guide them toward phishing pages and other malicious websites.</p>\n<p>\"This persistent threat actor focused on a wide range of targets, including journalists, people opposing the Fatah-led government, human rights activists and military groups including the Syrian opposition and Iraqi military,\" Facebook researchers leading the cyber espionage investigations <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/taking-action-against-hackers-in-palestine/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n<h3>A Sophisticated Espionage Campaign</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/aridviper\">Arid Viper</a>, on the other hand, was observed incorporating a new custom iOS surveillanceware dubbed \"Phenakite\" in their targeted campaigns, which Facebook noted was capable of stealing sensitive user data from iPhones without jailbreaking the devices prior to the compromise.</p>\n<p>Phenakite was delivered to users in the form of a fully functional but trojanized chat application named MagicSmile hosted on a third-party Chinese app development site that would surreptitiously run in the background and grab data stored on the phone without the user's knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The group also maintained a huge infrastructure comprising 179 domains that were used to host malware or acted as command-and-control (C2) servers.</p>\n\n<p>\"Lure content and known victims suggest the target demographic is individuals associated with pro-Fatah groups, Palestinian government organizations, military and security personnel, and student groups within Palestine,\" the researchers added.</p>\n<p>Facebook suspects Arid Viper used the iOS malware only in a handful of cases, suggesting a highly-targeted operation, with the Hamas-linked hackers simultaneously focusing on an evolving set of Android-based spyware apps that claimed to facilitate dating, networking, and regional banking in the Middle East, with the adversary masking the malware as fake app updates for legitimate apps like WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the malware urged victims to disable Google Play Protect and give the app device admin permissions, using the entrenched access to record calls, capture photos, audio, video, or screenshots, intercept messages, track device location, retrieve contacts, call logs, and calendar details, and even notification information from messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Imo, Viber, and Skype.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to add an extra layer of obfuscation, the malware was then found to contact a number of attacker-controlled sites, which in turn provided the implant with the C2 server for data exfiltration.</p>\n<p>\"Arid Viper recently expanded their offensive toolkit to include iOS malware that we believe is being deployed in targeted attacks against pro-Fatah groups and individuals,\" Facebook researchers said. \"As the technological sophistication of Arid Viper can be considered to be low to medium, this expansion in capability should signal to defenders that other low-tier adversaries may already possess, or can quickly develop, similar tooling.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Russian Intelligence Services.</p>\n\n<p>The companies include ERA Technopolis, Pasit, Federal State Autonomous Scientific Establishment Scientific Research Institute Specialized Security Computing Devices and Automation (SVA), Neobit, Advanced System Technology, and Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz (Positive Technologies), the last three of which are IT security firms whose customers are said to include

SolarWinds customers are believed to have received the trojanized Orion update, although the attackers carefully selected their targets, opting to escalate the attacks only in a handful of cases by deploying Teardrop malware based on an initial reconnaissance of the target environment for high-value accounts and assets.</p>\n\n<p>The adversary's compromise of the SolarWinds software supply chain

This attack achieved persistence and was able to evade internal systems long enough to gain access to the source code of the victim.</p>\n<p>Because of the far-reaching SolarWinds deployments, the perpetrators were also able to infiltrate many other organizations, looking for intellectual property and other assets.</p>\n<p>Among the co-victims: US government, government contractors, Information Technology companies, and NGOs. An incredible amount of sensitive data was stolen from several customers after a trojanized version of SolarWinds' application was installed on their internal structures.</p>\n<p>Looking at the technical capabilities of the malware, as you will see, this particular attack was quite impressive. A particular file, named <em>SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll</em> is a SolarWinds digitally signed component of the Orion software framework.</p>\n<p>The threat actors installed a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third-party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called \"Jobs,\" which includes the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services.</p>\n<p>So how could one protect the organization from Sunburst or a similar attack? Supply chain attacks have the advantage of establishing an initial foothold under the guise of a trusted 3rd party. But that's where the distinction ends; from there on, they progress like any other attack, and they can be detected if we know where to look. </p><p><b>Developing SIEM rules, using the SolarWinds attack as an example</b></p>\n<p>Let's start with Sigma rules; these create a sort of a common language to create and share quality queries regardless of the SIEM your organization uses. The <a href=\"https://cymulate.com/?utm_source=PaidPR&amp;utm_campaign=HackerNewsQ2-2021\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cymulate</a> platform will produce Sigma Rules for you to download these queries to your SIEM. This will enable Security Operations teams to build out the elements needed to detect future attacks. As you can see below in the 3 examples, the Sigma Rule is the same, yet the custom query is specifically for that SIEM's language. At the click of a button, you can switch to your preferred SIEM.</p>\n<p>Example 1: Splunk: </p>\n\n<p>Example 2: Qradar:</p>\n\n<p>Example 3: Azure Sentinel:</p>\n\n<p>Although Sigma rules are designed mostly for queries, one can use them to build a full anti-attack-chain SIEM or EDR rule. In the case of the SolarWinds Sunburst attack and many other attacks, Cymulate Sigma Rules are queries that search for the IOBs of the attack. Each sigma rule will query the SIEM for an IOB of one stage of the attack.</p>\n<p>When the IOBs from the sigma rules are combined, they can result in a specific rule for the target system \u2013 something that can, with a high degree of confidence, point out the attack without \"inventing the wheel\" all over again. All the required IOB's are in place \u2013 in the Sigma rules \u2013 you just need to reach out your hand and take them.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the specific case of a recreated SolarWinds attack on the Windows platform and hunt it together.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Hunting SolarWinds on Microsoft Windows</h2>\n<p>The Cymulate Platform provides us the capability to replicate the supply chain attack, which starts with an Exchange server mailbox export. The subsequent stages of the attack, available in the Cymulate platform to simulate the attack, can be seen in the screenshot.</p>\n<p>The first event will not get any trigger by Windows, but it will be written in various network logs. Since the event itself cannot be very specific, we will leave it as optional for placement in a general rule. Let's continue.</p>\n\n<p>The next event in the attack is downloading content with PowerShell. Such an event can be monitored with Windows Event IDs 4103 and 4104, which can also show the actual code being run, but we don't want to limit ourselves to a specific method because, let's face it: PowerShell is not the only tool an attacker can use.</p>\n<p>What is common to all tools is that while downloading content, an object is created in the system, and for that, there is a Windows Event ID 4663 with an indicator of Access mask 0x1 or, if you use Sysmon, Event ID 11.</p>\n<p>Below is a general screenshot of a 4663 Event ID with the relevant fields highlighted. This is the event that the Cymulate Sigma rule detects, and it is also the first IOB in the rule that we will create. You can find more on this Event ID <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4663\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Next in line is the next stage in the attack: <em>Task Scheduler: Masquerading Tasks triggered on the windows lock screen for lateral movement. </em>Once again, it is irrelevant exactly which Tasks are being masqueraded; what is important is that there are Windows Event ID's that can help us identify this chain of events.</p>\n<p>The Event ID's are:</p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p>4698 - task created</p>\n<p>4700 - Scheduled task enabled.</p>\n<p>4702 - Scheduled task updated.</p>\n<p>4699 - Scheduled task removed.</p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>What is relevant for us is, of course, is 4698 as this will pop up when a new task is created. Events of updating, enabling and/or removing a task are a good enhancement but optional. Personally, I would recommend adding an option of 4699, since there is always a possibility that the attacker would like to remove the task after completion to cover his tracks.</p>\n<p>So, what we will want for minimal requirements is 4698 with a set of specific regexes in the \"Command\" field in the event, that match known executable types for example:</p>\n<p></p><blockquote> - '.exe' - '.py - '.ps1' - '.msi - '.msp' - '.mst' - '.ws' - '.wsf' - '.vb' - '.vbs' - '.jst' - '.cmd' - '.cpl'</blockquote><p></p>\n<p>For complex cases, regular expressions, such as those below, can be used: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> - '^([A-Za-z0-9+/]{4})*([A-Za-z0-9+/]{3}=|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{2}==)?$' </li>\n<li>-'^([A-Za-z0-9 \\/]{4})*([A-Za-z0-9 \\/]{3}=|[A-Za-z0-9 \\/]{2}==)?$'</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pay special attention to the last two IOBs (regexes): these match a base64 pattern. Although \"Scheduled Task\" receives a string as an input, it is possible to write in it an obfuscated/encrypted form of a command. For example, \"python\" as command and \"base64.b64decode(<em>some base64 payload</em>)\" as an argument, thus effectively making your task into \"decoding base64 payload\" tool.</p>\n<p>Once again, all the indicators can be found in the Sigma Rules supplied by Cymulate. We will call this list and other upcoming lists of IOB's just \"relevant IOB list\" for the purpose of convenience. Below is the general view of the 4698 Event ID of creating a new task.</p>\n\n<p>So, by now, we have covered two events in the chain. These should occur on the same machine and with the same username. After that, the process in your task will be executed, resulting in 4688 Event ID with Creator Process name: TaskScheduler or TaskScheduler.dll or taskeng.exe (depending on the version of build you use), and <em>New Process Name</em> will have one of those IOB's in the executables list. So, at this stage, our Rule looks like this:</p>\n<p></p><blockquote>(4663 + Access mask 0x1)\ud83e\udc6a (4698 and relevant IOB list)\ud83e\udc6a (4688+list of relevant Creator Process name + list of relevant IOBs as part of New process Name)</blockquote><p></p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p>4663 + Access mask 0x1 or Sysmon 11)\ud83e\udc6a [(4698 + relevant IOB list) \ud83e\udc6a(4688+(TaskScheduler.dll or taskeng.exe))]</p>\n<p>The \ud83e\udc6a sign represents \"followed by\" operation</p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>The next stage in the attack is running DLL file with rundll32. This is a simple IOB, which, by the way, can be run in a previous step as well. In this specific case it is 4688+rundll.32 </p>\n<p>Next is <em>ADFind : Enumerating an AD Group using ADFind Masqueraded as csrss.exe</em>. This step is a bit tricky. During this step an attacker masquerades his enumerating tool as some legitimate file. However, before this can happen, the illegitimate file has to be written somewhere on one of your drives (preferably in the system folder) with the legitimate name.</p>\n<p>In this specific case it is csrss.exe, but there is quite a large number of file names that could be used for the same purpose for example:</p>\n<p></p><blockquote><p> - 'svchost.exe'. - rundll32.exe. - services.exe. - powershell.exe. - regsvr32.exe. - spoolsv.exe</p>\n<p> - lsass.exe. - smss.exe. - csrss.exe. - conhost.exe. - wininit.exe. - winlogon.exe. - explorer.exe</p>\n<p> - taskhost.exe. - Taskmgr.exe. - sihost.exe - RuntimeBroker.exe - smartscreen.exe. </p></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>Again, no need to search for all of them, they are already supplied in the relevant Sigma rule.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of one possible Sigma rule for this specific step, which detects creating a file with one of the specified above names. But with a hash that is different from the original. Whether overriding a system file or creating a new path, it will still result in a 4663 Event ID (or Sysmon Event ID 11), and one of the names below will be found in the payload. </p>\n\n<p>Working with System files also requires privileged access, so there inevitably will be privilege escalation, which is also documented as 4688 Event ID (file access) and Token Elevation Type of %%1936 or %%1937, which are types for system and administrator access respectively.</p>\n<p>Below is a screenshot of the 4688 Event ID with relevant fields highlighted.</p>\n\n<p>Optionally you could search for 4672 Event ID with any of the privilege escalation strings, but the event of privilege escalation can happen at any step in the attack. We recommend a separate rule for this, which should be correlated with the rule we are building.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at our rule at this stage: </p>\n<p></p><blockquote>(4663 + Access mask 0x1 or Sysmon 11)\ud83e\udc6a [(4698 + relevant IOB list) \ud83e\udc6a(4688+(TaskScheduler.dll or taskeng.exe)) \ud83e\udc6a (4688 and rundll32) \ud83e\udc6a (4663 or Sysmon 11 + generic list of system files) \ud83e\udc6a (4688 and 1 of files in list and Token Elevation Type (%%1936 OR %%1937))]</blockquote><p></p>\n<p>The next step is \"<em>Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry</em>\". What happens here is an attacker executes an obfuscated code previously written into a registry value. As you could understand, before he can do this, he needs to create a new registry value or modify an existing one.</p>\n<p>A Windows event ID 4657 and a value matching base64 pattern (which can be identified with regexes that we have already seen in a preceding step) can help identify this step. The event can include \"Existing registry value modified\" or \"Creating new registry value\" as the <em>Operation Type. </em>All the IOB's, as mentioned before, can be obtained from the supplied Sigma Rules.</p>\n<p>This event can show you other valuable information, such as:</p><p><b>1) </b>What key was involved.</p>\n<p> The format is: \\REGISTRY\\HIVE\\PATH where:</p>\n<p> HIVE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE = \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE</li>\n<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER = \\REGISTRY\\USER\\[USER_SID], where [USER_SID] is the SID of current user.</li>\n<li>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT = \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes</li>\n<li>HKEY_USERS = \\REGISTRY\\USER</li>\n<li>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG = \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Hardware Profiles\\Current</li>\n</ul><b>2) </b>What is the originating process.<br/><b>3) </b>What is the old value and the new value.<br/><ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Below you can view a general representation of 4657 Event ID.</p>\n<p>Taking into account possible timeframes, since the entire operation will probably be scripted, we can safely say that if successful, steps 2-6 will take no more than 5 seconds.

It was seen dropping stealers (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/taurus-new-stealer-town\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Taurus</a> Stealer) or further loaders (<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/388d18b98704bff34ac1cb0a6603e68ba300205ee2f14e4bf482f1012d933231/detection\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>), yet its design allows [it] to utilize it for distributing any kind of malware,\" said Aleksandra \"Hasherezade\" Doniec, a threat intelligence analyst at <a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-saint-bot-downloader/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Malwarebytes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Furthermore, Saint Bot employs a wide variety of techniques which, although not novel, indicate some level of sophistication considering its relatively new appearance.\"</p>\n<p>The infection chain analyzed by the cybersecurity firm begins with a phishing email containing an embedded ZIP file (\"bitcoin.zip\") that claims to be a bitcoin wallet when, in fact, it's a PowerShell script under the guise of .LNK shortcut file. This PowerShell script then downloads the next stage malware, a WindowsUpdate.exe executable, which, in turn, drops a second executable (InstallUtil.exe) that takes care of downloading two more executables named def.exe and putty.exe.</p>\n\n<p>While the former is a batch script responsible for disabling Windows Defender, putty.exe contains the malicious payload that eventually connects to a command-and-control (C2) server for further exploitation.</p>\n<p>The obfuscation present in each stage of the infection, coupled with the anti-analysis techniques adopted by the malware, allows the malware operators to exploit the devices they were installed on without attracting attention.</p>\n<p>Besides performing \"self defense checks\" to verify the presence of a debugger or a virtual environment, Saint Bot is designed to not execute in Romania and select countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The list of commands supported by the malware include \u2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>downloading and executing other payloads retrieved from the C2 server</li>\n<li>updating the bot malware, and</li>\n<li>uninstalling itself from the compromised machine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these capabilities may seem very small, the fact that Saint Bot serves as a downloader for other malware makes it dangerous enough.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the payloads themselves are fetched from files hosted on Discord, a tactic that has become increasingly common among threat actors, who are abusing legitimate functions of such platforms for C2 communications, evade security, and deliver malware.</p>\n<p>\"When files are uploaded and stored within the Discord CDN, they can be accessed using the hardcoded CDN URL by any system, regardless of whether Discord has been installed, simply by browsing to the CDN URL where the content is hosted,\" researchers from Cisco Talos <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/04/collab-app-abuse.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a> in an analysis earlier this week, thus turning software like Discord and Slack into lucrative targets for hosting malicious content.</p>\n<p>\"Saint Bot is yet another tiny downloader,\" Hasherezade said. \"[It is] not as mature as SmokeLoader, but it is quite new and currently actively developed. The author seems to have some knowledge of malware design, which is visible by the wide range of techniques used. Yet, all the deployed techniques are well-known and pretty standard, [and] not showing much creativity so far.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Targets in other countries, including Canada, Belgium, Britain, and Israel, were also hit.</p>\n<p>The Cynet webinar unpacks the attack to explain the build process used by the attackers and then highlights the capabilities of the Sunburst, Teardrop, and Raindrop malware used in the attack.</p>\n<p>Then, Cynet reviews the clever \"kill switch\" capabilities built into the backdoor to help ensure that it would not be discovered by security analysts. </p>\n<p>Also, the webinar discusses the many new vulnerabilities that were exposed in SolarWinds' software and their ramifications.</p>\n<h3>A Look Forward</h3>\n<p>With a full understanding of how the attack was carried out, we can then determine whether we're likely to see these types of supply chain attacks proliferate and whether nation-states are already targeting key suppliers. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in a field where success begets success, it's all too certain that similar attack approaches are actively underway somewhere. Cynet also shares their perspective on this topic during the webinar.</p>\n<p>Given that most companies do rely on third-party providers for much of their core software, what should they do to protect themselves? Especially given that these companies have little choice but to continue their use of third-party software that could potentially be weaponized, despite the best efforts of the third-party providers to protect themselves. </p>\n<p>Cynet provides guidance on defense measures that should be applied to ensure you're not a victim of a supply chain attack even though you have no visibility or control over your supplier's security. It's important that companies come to realize that these trusted third-party relationships can, and have been, compromised. And action must be taken now. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cynet.easywebinar.live/lessons-learned-from-the-solarwinds-sunburst-attack-registration/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Register for the webinar here</a></p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The Norwegian National Security Authority said it has implemented a vulnerability scan of IP addresses in the country to identify vulnerable Exchange servers and \"continuously notify these companies.\"</p>\n<p>The colossal scale of the ongoing offensive against Microsoft's email servers also eclipses the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/nearly-18000-solarwinds-customers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SolarWinds hacking spree</a> that came to light last December, which is said to have targeted as many as 18,000 customers of the IT management tools provider. But as it was with the SolarWinds hack, the attackers are likely to have only gone after high-value targets based on an initial reconnaissance of the victim machines.</p>\n<h3>Unpatched Exchange Servers at Risk of Exploitation</h3>\n<p>A successful <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exploitation of the flaws</a> allows the adversaries to break into Microsoft Exchange Servers in target environments and subsequently allow the installation of unauthorized web-based backdoors to facilitate long-term access. With multiple threat actors leveraging these zero-day vulnerabilities, the post-exploitation activities are expected to differ from one group to the other based on their motives.</p>\n<p>Chief among the vulnerabilities is CVE-2021-26855, also called \"ProxyLogon\" (no connection to ZeroLogon), which permits an attacker to bypass the authentication of an on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server that's able to receive untrusted connections from an external source on port 443. This is followed by the exploitation of CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065 post-authentication, allowing the malicious party to gain remote access.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese cybersecurity firm Devcore, which began an internal audit of Exchange Server security in October last year, <a href=\"https://proxylogon.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted in a timeline</a> that it discovered both CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065 within a 10-day period between December 10-20, 2020. After chaining these bugs into a workable pre-authentication RCE exploit, the company said it reported the issue to Microsoft on January 5, 2021, suggesting that Microsoft had almost two months to release a fix.</p>\n\n<p>The four security issues in question were eventually <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/urgent-4-actively-exploited-0-day-flaws.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">patched by Microsoft</a> as part of an emergency out-of-band security update last Tuesday, while warning that \"many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems.\"</p>\n<p>The fact that Microsoft also patched Exchange Server 2010 suggests that the vulnerabilities have been lurking in the code for more than ten years.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which released an <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-on-in.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emergency directive</a> warning of \"active exploitation\" of the vulnerabilities, urged government agencies running vulnerable versions of Exchange Server to either update the software or disconnect the products from their networks.</p>\n\n<p>\"CISA is aware of widespread domestic and international exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and urges scanning Exchange Server logs with Microsoft's IoC detection tool to help determine compromise,\" the agency <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USCERT_gov/status/1368216461571919877\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> on March 6.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that merely installing the patches issued by Microsoft would have no effect on servers that have already been backdoored. Organizations that have been breached to deploy the web shell and other post-exploitation tools continue to remain at risk of future compromise until the artifacts are completely rooted out from their networks.</p>\n<h3>Multiple Clusters Spotted</h3>\n<p>FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence team <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> it \"observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment\" since the start of the year. Cybersecurity firm Volexity, one of the firms credited with discovering the flaws, said the intrusion campaigns appeared to have started around January 6, 2021.</p>\n<p>Not much is known about the identities of the attackers, except that Microsoft has primarily attributed the exploits with high confidence to a group it calls Hafnium, a skilled government-backed group operating out of China. Mandiant is tracking the intrusion activity in three clusters, UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643, adding it expects the number to increase as more attacks are detected.</p>\n<p>In a statement to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-microsoft/more-than-20000-u-s-organizations-compromised-through-microsoft-flaw-source-idUSKBN2AX23U\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a>, a Chinese government spokesman denied the country was behind the intrusions.</p>\n<p>\"There are at least five different clusters of activity that appear to be exploiting the vulnerabilities,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1368289931970322433\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Katie Nickels, director of threat intelligence at Red Canary, while noting the differences in the techniques and infrastructure from that of the Hafnium actor.</p>\n<p>In one particular instance, the cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1367935292724948992\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">observed</a> that some of the customers compromised Exchange servers had been deployed with a crypto-mining software called <a href=\"https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/cb-tau-technical-analysis-dltminer-campaign-targeting-corporations-in-asia/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DLTminer</a>, a malware documented by Carbon Black in 2019.</p>\nlinkads\n<p>\"One possibility is that Hafnium adversaries shared or sold exploit code, resulting in other groups being able to exploit these vulnerabilities,\" Nickels said. \"Another is that adversaries could have reverse engineered the patches released by Microsoft to independently figure out how to exploit the vulnerabilities.\"</p>\n<h3>Microsoft Issues Mitigation Guidance</h3>\n<p>Aside from rolling out fixes, Microsoft has published new alternative mitigation guidance to help Exchange customers who need more time to patch their deployments, in addition to pushing out a new update for the Microsoft Safety Scanner (MSERT) tool to detect web shells and <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">releasing a script</a> for checking HAFNIUM indicators of compromise. They can be found <a href=\"https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-mitigations-march-2021/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\"These vulnerabilities are significant and need to be taken seriously,\" Mat Gangwer, senior director of managed threat response at Sophos said. \"They allow attackers to remotely execute commands on these servers without the need for credentials, and any threat actor could potentially abuse them.\"</p>\n<p>\"The broad installation of Exchange and its exposure to the internet mean that many organizations running an on-premises Exchange server could be at risk,\" Gangwer added.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

In one case spotted by the researchers, an advice for a real estate agreement surfaced a breached neonatal medical practice based in Canada as the first result.</p>\n<p>\"To ensure targets from the right geographies are captured, the adversaries rewrite website code 'on the go' so that website visitors who fall outside the desired countries are shown benign web content, while those from the right location are shown a page featuring a fake discussion forum on the topic they've queried,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>Clicking the search result takes the user to a fake message board-like page that matches not only the search terms used in the initial query but also includes a link to the ZIP file, which contains a heavily obfuscated Javascript file that initiates the next stage of compromise to inject the fileless malware fetched from a remote server into memory.</p>\n\n<p>This takes the form of a multi-stage evasive approach that begins with a .NET loader, which comprises a Delphi-based loader malware, which, in turn, contains the final payload in encrypted form.</p>\n<p>In addition to delivering the REvil ransomware and the Gootkit trojan, multiple campaigns have been spotted currently leveraging the Gootloader framework to deliver the Kronos financial malware in Germany stealthily, and the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation tool in the U.S.</p>\n<p>It's still unclear as to how the operators gain access to the websites to serve the malicious injects, but the researchers suspect the attackers may have obtained the passwords by installing the Gootkit malware or purchasing stolen credentials from underground markets, or by leveraging security flaws in present in the plugins used alongside content management system (CMS) software.</p>\n<p>The findings have been echoed by Microsoft in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1366542130731094021\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">series of tweets</a>, noting it's \"seeing numerous extensive hands-on-keyboard attacks emanating from the Gootkit malware, which is distributed via drive-by downloads as a JavaScript within a ZIP file.\"</p>\n<p>\"The developers behind Gootkit appear to have shifted resources and energy from delivering just their own financial malware to creating a stealthy, complex delivery platform for all kinds of payloads, including REvil ransomware,\" said Gabor Szappanos, threat research director at Sophos.</p>\n<p>\"This shows that criminals tend to reuse their proven solutions instead of developing new delivery mechanisms. Further, instead of actively attacking endpoint tools as some malware distributors do, the creators of Gootloader have opted for convoluted evasive techniques that conceal the end result,\" he added.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

It has also been reported to have been modified in order to deliver second-stage malware on targeted hosts.</p>\n<p>Campaigns using Scanbox were previously spotted in March 2019 by <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/scanbox-framework-campaign/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Recorded Future</a> targeting visitors to the website of Pakistan's Directorate General of Immigration and Passports (DGIP) and a fake typosquatted domain claiming to be the official Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).</p>\n<p>The introduction of the FriarFox browser extension in TA413's arsenal points to APT actors' \"insatiable hunger\" for access to cloud-based email accounts, says Sherrod DeGrippo, Proofpoint's senior director of threat research and detection.</p>\n<p>\"The complex delivery method of the tool [...] grants this APT actor near total access to the Gmail accounts of their victims, which is especially troubling as email accounts really are among the highest value assets when it comes to human intelligence,\" DeGrippo noted.</p>\n<p>\"Almost any other account password can be reset once attackers have access to someone's email account. Threat actors can also use compromised email accounts to send email from that account using the user's email signature and contact list, which makes those messages extremely convincing.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

But ransomware proves to be a different animal\u2014most destructive, persistent, notoriously challenging to prevent, and is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>\n<p>Falling victim to a ransomware attack can cause significant data loss, data breach, operational downtime, costly recovery, legal consequences, and reputational damage.</p>\n<p>In this story, we have covered everything you need to know about ransomware and how it works.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What is ransomware?</strong></h2>\n<p>Ransomware is a malicious program that gains control over the infected device, encrypts files, and blocks user access to the data or a system until a sum of money, or ransom, is paid.</p>\n<p>Crooks' scheme includes a ransom note\u2014with amount and instructions on how to pay a ransom in return for the decryption key\u2014or direct communication with the victim.</p>\n<p>While ransomware impacts businesses and institutions of every size and type, attackers often target healthcare, education, IT, government, and finance sectors with deeper pockets\u2014causing damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Ransomware attacks started picking up in 2012, and since then, it has become the most pervasive cyber-attacks across the world.</p>\n<p>For instance, HelloKitty ransomware hit Polish video game developer CD Projekt Red last week with quite a popular tactic, i.e., attackers threatened the company to leak the source code of games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3, Gwent, and along with confidential files in the company.</p>\n<p>And it's actually happened! After CD Projekt announced that they would not be paying the ransom, attackers created an auction for the stolen data on a hacker forum.</p>\n<p>And it isn't the only example. Ransomware has always been one of the most popular kinds of malicious samples uploaded in <a href=\"https://any.run/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">malware analysis sandbox ANY.RUN</a>. Over 124,00 interactive sessions with ransomware were analyzed online only in 2020.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>From a locker to the enterprise</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the ways to protect from attacks is awareness. We believe it is a must for enterprise executives and employees to understand this type of threat.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll take a look at the history of ransomware:</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">The first ransomware</h4>\n<p>The first known ransomware attack was carried out in 1989 by an AIDS researcher, Joseph Popp, who distributed malicious 20,000 floppy disks to AIDS researchers spanning more than 90 countries, claiming that the disks contained a survey program. Since then, the ransomware threat has evolved a lot and acquired more features.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Locker ransomware</h4>\n<p>In 2007, Locker ransomware, a new category of ransomware malware, appeared that does not encrypt files; instead, it locks the victim out of their device, preventing them from using it.</p>\n<p>Similar to this, WinLock demanded a $10 ransom for the unlocking code. Later, Citadel, Lyposit, and Reveton worm controlled a screen with a fine message from a fake law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p>This typically takes the form of locking the computer's or device's user interface and then asking the user to pay a fee to restore access to it.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Scareware </h4>\n<p>In later years, attackers changed their strategy to capitalize on fear by spreading faking applications and antivirus (AV) programs. The attack involves a pop-up message displayed to victims saying that their computers have been infected with viruses. It lures victims to a website where they're asked for money to pay for software to fix the problem. Everything looked trustworthy: logos, color schemes, and other copyrighted materials. </p>\n<p>From that moment, criminals understood that it was much easier to compromise several websites, focus on phishing, and get the whole process automated.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Crypto ransomware</h4>\n<p>In 2013, CryptoLocker emerged as the first cryptographic malware that typically arrives as an email attachment. The Gameover ZeuS botnet was responsible for these attacks. CryptoLocker encrypts files, and after that, a bitcoin payment was required to unlock them.</p>\n<p>If the ransom wasn't received in 3 days, the ransom doubled. CryptorBit, CryptoDefense, CryptoWall, WannaCry enlarged decoy variations and even used system weaknesses to infect computers.</p>\n<p>The latest step in that evolution is the arrival of ransomware-as-a-service, which first appeared in 2015 with the Tox toolkit launch. It gave would-be cybercriminals the option to develop custom ransomware tools with advanced evasion capabilities.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Enterprise ransomware</h4>\n<p>Ransomware attackers leveled up and went to the enterprise stage. They preferred to deal with large organizations and scare them of a possible outbreak. </p>\n<p>For example, a target got an email with a threat of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. To avoid it, victims needed to pay a ransom.</p>\n<p>One more case is the data compromise ransom. A criminal threatens a target to exploit compromised information to the public unless a ransom is paid. The following tactic is effective on the enterprise level, as companies don't want to put their reputation at stake. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now it's clear that malware will continue to evolve. And maybe it will acquire hybrid attacks, including other malware families.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Attack in details </strong></h2>\n<p>As we now know the history and types of ransomware, now it's time to understand how it works.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Deployment:</b> In the first step, attackers distribute essential components used to infect, encrypt, or lock the system, downloaded without the user's knowledge, using phishing, or after exploiting targeted system flaws.</li><li><b>Installation: </b>When the payload is downloaded, the next step is infection. The malware drops a small file that is often capable of defense evasion. The ransomware executes and attempts to gain persistence on the infected system by putting itself to autorun the registry keys, allowing remote attackers to control the system. </li><li><b>Command-and-Control: </b>The malware then connects to the attackers' command and control (C2) server to receive instructions and, primarily, to deposit the asymmetric private encryption key out of the victim's reach.</li><li><b>Destruction: </b>Once files get encrypted, the malware deletes original copies on the system, and the only way to restore them is to decrypt encoded files.</li><li><b>Extortion:</b> Here come ransom notes. The victim gets to know that his data is compromised. The payment range varies according to the type of target. To confuse and scare a victim, attackers may delete several files from the computer. However, if a user pays the ransom, it isn't a guarantee that the information will be restored or ransomware itself will be deleted. </li></ul><p></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Popular families and operators</strong></h2>\n<p>Several types of malware are famous in the ransomware world. Let's look through them and talk about popular operators that stand out in malware history:</p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://any.run/malware-trends/gandcrab\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GandCrab ransomware</a> is one of the most notorious ransomware releases in the last few years that amassed nearly $2 billion in payments from its victims.</p>\n<p>Believed to be a product of a Russian hacker group, GandCrab was discovered in 2018 as a part of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) sold to other cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>Though GandCrab announced \"retirement\" in 2019, some researchers claim that it returned with a new strain, called Sodinokibi, with a similar codebase. <a href=\"https://any.run/malware-trends/sodinokibi\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sodinokibi</a> targets Microsoft Windows systems and encrypts all files except configuration files.</p>\n<p>2) Next, <a href=\"https://any.run/malware-trends/maze\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maze</a> ransomware, which made headlines in the last two years, is known for releasing stolen data to the public if the victim does not pay to decrypt it.</p>\n<p>It was the first ransomware attack that combined data encryption with information theft. Moreover, they threatened to make the data public if the ransom was not paid. When the COVID-19 started, Maze announced that they would leave hospitals alone. But later, they broke that promise as well.</p>\n<p>In 2020 Maze announced they shut down its operations. But it's more likely that they just moved to another malware. </p>\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://any.run/malware-trends/netwalker\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netwalker</a> used process hollowing and code obfuscation to target corporate victims. But in January 2021, law enforcement agencies teamed up against Netwalker and took over domains in a dark web used by malware actors.</p>\n<p>4) <a href=\"https://any.run/malware-trends/wannacry\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wannacry</a> spreads autonomously from computer to computer using EternalBlue, an exploit supposedly developed by the NSA and then stolen by hackers.</p>\n<p>It is the most uploaded type of ransomware in ANY.RUN service in 2020. It hit top malware with 1930 tasks. You can investigate them in <a href=\"https://app.any.run/submissions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the public submission library</a>, search by the \"wannacry\" tag.</p>\n<p>5) Avaddon's malspam usually contains the only smiley to lure users into downloading the attachment. The malware also checks the user's locale before infecting. If it is Russian or Cherokee, Avaddon doesn't encrypt systems.</p>\n<p>6) Babuk is a new malware targeting enterprises in 2021. Babuk comprises secure encryption that makes it impossible to restore files for free.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Targets of ransomware attacks</strong></h2>\n<p>There are several reasons attackers first choose what kind of organizations they want to target with ransomware: </p>\n<p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong>Easy to evade defense.</strong> Universities, small companies that have small security teams are an easy target. File sharing and an extensive database make the penetration simple for attackers.</li><li><strong>Possibility of a quick payment.</strong> Some organizations are forced to pay a ransom quickly. Government agencies or medical facilities often need immediate access to their data. Law firms and other organizations with sensitive data usually want to keep a compromise a secret.</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>And some ransomware spreads automatically, and anyone can become its victim.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Rapid Growth of Ransomware</strong></h2>\n<p>The main reason why this type of malware has become successful is the attacks that bring results to cybercriminals. Markets let crooks buy advanced ransomware for making money.</p>\n<p>Malware authors provide several ways to pack the ransomware. Malicious software encrypts systems quickly and stealthily. As soon as the ransom is received, it is no challenge to cover the tracks. These points lead to a significant increase. </p>\n<p>Now criminals go bald and expect to get hundreds or thousands of dollars as companies don't want to risk data loss and outages. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ransomware distribution methods</strong></h2>\n<p>Here are several ways of how ransomware spreads: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email (spam)</li>\n<li>Watering Hole attack</li>\n<li>Malvertising</li>\n<li>Exploit kits</li>\n<li>USB and removable media</li>\n<li>Ransomware as a service</li>\n<li>Zero days</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ransomware analysis in ANY.RUN</strong></h2>\n<p>Let's investigate a<a href=\"https://app.any.run/tasks/e64c8bb1-c024-4233-a48f-9a202307533f\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> sample of ransomware</a> together. </p>\n<p>Here is a task with Sodinokibi malware.

Demers of the Justice Department's National Security Division.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.\"</p>\n<p>The latest indictment is yet another sign of how the Lazarus Group relies on cyber cryptocurrency heists and cybertheft against businesses and critical infrastructure in order to fund a country that's been heavily hit by economic sanctions.</p>\n<p>The group, which earned a place in the U.S. government's <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/lazarus-north-korean-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctions list</a> in 2019, has been linked into a wide array of criminal cyber activities, both in the U.S. and abroad, including the destructive <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/05/how-to-wannacry-ransomware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WannaCry ransomware</a> outbreak of 2017, the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/05/swift-banking-hack.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SWIFT attacks</a> on banks and ATM networks to steal more than $1.2 billion, conducting spear-phishing campaigns, and carrying out cryptocurrency thefts amounting to at least $112 million.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the indictment also details the defendants' plans to create their own crypto-token called Marine Chain in 2017-18, which would let users purchase stakes in shipping vessels, but in reality, was a money-making initiative aimed at secretly obtaining funds for the government while evading international sanctions.</p>\n<h3>\"AppleJeus\" Backdoor to Steal Cryptocurrency</h3>\n<p>Also undertaken by the conspiracy is a scheme that involved creating malicious applications that masqueraded as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms, only to use them as a backdoor to transfer money to their accounts fraudulently.</p>\n<p>Calling the backdoor \"<a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AppleJeus</a>,\" the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said it discovered at least seven different versions of the malware since 2018, with the Lazarus Group banking on a mix of phishing, social networking, and social engineering techniques as initial infection vectors to trick users into downloading it.</p>\n\n<p>The rogue applications identified by CISA comprises of Ants2Whale, Celas Trade Pro, CoinGo Trade, CryptoNeuro Trader, Dorusio, iCryptoFx, Kupay Wallet, Union Crypto Trader, and WorldBit-Bot.</p>\n\n<p>Energy, finance, government, industry, technology, and telecommunications sectors were the prominent focus of the attacks, the agency detailed, adding AppleJeus targets both Windows and Mac operating systems, echoing a previous <a href=\"https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">August 2018 report</a> from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>\n<h3>Canadian-American Citizen Charged for Money Laundering</h3>\n<p>U.S. prosecutors said the three men were stationed by the North Korean government in other countries such as China and Russia with the goal of furthering the strategic and financial interests of the Kim Jong Un-led regime. The DoJ, however, did not elaborate on whether threat actors from either country collaborated with the North Korean operatives on these attacks.</p>\n<p>In a related development, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) obtained warrants to seize cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million that were allegedly plundered from an unnamed financial services company in New York and held at two cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>\n<p>A second case that was also unsealed yesterday concerned a Canadian-American citizen named Ghaleb Alaumary, who pled guilty in a money-laundering scheme and admitted to carrying out ATM \"cash-out\" operations and a cyber-enabled bank heist orchestrated by North Korean hackers.</p>\nlinkads\n<p>Although the individuals are unlikely to be extradited and brought to trial, Jon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.

It also communicates using HTTPS with its command-and-control (C2) server in order to retrieve a list of commands to run.</p>\n<p>In addition, ANSSI's investigation revealed the use of common VPN services in order to connect to web shells, with overlaps in C2 infrastructure connecting the operation to Sandworm.</p>\n\n<p>\"The intrusion set Sandworm is known to lead consequent intrusion campaigns before focusing on specific targets that fits its strategic interests within the victims pool,\" the researchers detailed. \"The campaign observed by ANSSI fits this behaviour.\"</p>\n<p>In light of the SolarWinds supply-chain attack, it should come as no surprise that monitoring systems such as Centreon have become a lucrative target for bad actors to gain a foothold and laterally move across victim environments. But unlike the former's supply chain compromise, the newly disclosed attacks differ in that they appear to have been carried out by leveraging internet-facing servers running Centreon's software inside the victims' networks.</p>\n<p>\"It is therefore recommended to update applications as soon as vulnerabilities are public and corrective patches are issued,\" ANSSI warned. \"It is recommended either not to expose these tools' web interfaces to [the] Internet or to restrict such access using non-applicative authentication.\"</p>\n<p>In October 2020, the U.S. government <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/russian-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formally charged</a> six Russian military officers for their participation in destructive malware attacks orchestrated by this group, in addition to linking the Sandworm actor to Unit 74455 of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency part of the Russian Army.</p>\n<h3>UPDATE</h3>\n<p>French software company Centreon on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.centreon.com/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/centreon-provides-clarification-following-the-publication-of-the-anssi-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> a clarification following the publication of ANSSI's report, stating none of its customers were affected in the hacking campaign that was found to strike business entities running its network monitoring software.</p>\n<p>\"The campaign described by ANSSI exclusively concerns obsolete versions of Centreon's open source software,\" which it said is no longer being actively supported for five years, adding \"only about fifteen entities were the target of this campaign.</p>\n<p>ANSSI, in its analysis, had said the attacks specifically targeted web-hosting companies.</p>\n<p>Besides urging users of its outdated software to update to the latest version, Centreon also made it a point to stress that the campaign is not a supply chain type attack and that \"no parallel with other attacks of this type can be made in this case.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

But the \"synergistic effect\" created by using two different sets of attack vectors to strike the same targets cannot be overlooked, the researchers said.</p>\n<h3>Domestic Kitten Mimics a Tehran Restaurant App</h3>\n<p>Domestic Kitten, which has been <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/domestic-kitten-an-iranian-surveillance-operation/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">active since 2016</a>, has been known to target specific groups of individuals with malicious Android apps that collect sensitive information such as SMS messages, call logs, photos, videos, and location data on the device along with their voice recordings.</p>\n<p>Spotting four active campaigns, the most recent of which began in November 2020 according to Check Point, the APT-C-50 actor has been found to leverage a wide variety of cover apps, counting VIPRE Mobile Security (a fake mobile security application), Exotic Flowers (a repackaged variant of a game available on Google Play), and Iranian Woman Ninja (a wallpaper app), to distribute a piece of malware called FurBall.</p>\n\n<p>The latest November operation is no different, which takes advantage of a fake app for Mohsen Restaurant located in Tehran to achieve the same objective by luring victims into installing the app by multiple vectors \u2014 SMS messages with a link to download the malware, an Iranian blog that hosts the payload, and even shared via Telegram channels.</p>\n<p>Prominent targets of the attack included 1,200 individuals located in Iran, the US, Great Britain, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan, the researchers said, with over 600 successful infections reported.</p>\n<p>Once installed, FurBall grants itself wide permissions to execute the app every time automatically on device startup and proceeds to collect browser history, hardware information, files on the external SD card, and periodically exfiltrate videos, photos, and call records every 20 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>It also monitors clipboard content, gains access to all notifications received by the device, and comes with capabilities to remotely execute commands issued from a command-and-control (C2) server to record audio, video, and phone calls.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, FurBall appears to be based on a commercially available Spyware called KidLogger, implying the actors \"either obtained the KidLogger source-code, or reverse-engineered a sample and stripped all extraneous parts, then added more capabilities.\"</p>\n<h3>Infy Returns With New, Previously Unknown, Second-Stage Malware</h3>\n<p>First discovered in <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">May 2016</a> by Palo Alto Networks, Infy's (also called Prince of Persia) renewed activity in April 2020 marks a continuation of the group's cyber operations that have targeted Iranian dissidents and diplomatic agencies across Europe for over a decade.</p>\n\n<p>While their surveillance efforts <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-of-persia-game-over/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">took a beating</a> in June 2016 following a takedown operation by Palo Alto Networks to sinkhole the group's C2 infrastructure, Infy <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-persia-ride-lightning-infy-returns-foudre/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resurfaced in August 2017</a> with anti-takeover techniques alongside a new Windows info-stealer called Foudre.</p>\n<p>The group is also suggested to have ties to the Telecommunication Company of Iran after researchers Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Guarnieri-Iran-And-The-Soft-War-For-Internet-Dominance-wp.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed evidence in July 2016</a> that a subset of the C2 domains redirecting to the sinkhole was blocked by DNS tampering and HTTP filtering, thus preventing access to the sinkhole.</p>\n<p>Then in 2018, Intezer Labs found a new version of the Foudre malware, called <a href=\"https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-foudre/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">version 8</a>, that also contained an \"unknown binary\" \u2014 now named Tonnerre by Check Point that's used to expand on the capabilities of the former.</p>\nlinkads\n<p>\"It seems that following a long downtime, the Iranian cyber attackers were able to regroup, fix previous issues and dramatically reinforce their OPSEC activities as well as the technical proficiency and abilities of their tools,\" the researchers said.</p>\n<p>As many as three versions of Foudre (20-22) have been uncovered since April 2020, with the new variants downloading Tonnerre 11 as the next-stage payload.</p>\n<p>The attack chain commences by sending phishing emails containing lure documents written in Persian, that when closed, runs a malicious macro that drops and executes the Foudre backdoor, which then connects to the C2 server to download the Tonnerre implant.</p>\n<p>Besides executing commands from the C2 server, recording sounds, and capturing screenshots, what makes Tonnerre stand out is its use of two sets of C2 servers \u2014 one to receive commands and download updates using HTTP and a second server to which the stolen data is exfiltrated via FTP.</p>\n<p>At 56MB, Tonnerre's unusual size is also likely to work in its favor and evade detection as many vendors ignore large files during malware scans, the researchers noted.</p>\n<p>However, unlike Domestic Kitten, only a few dozen victims were found to be targeted in this attack, including those from Iraq, Azerbaijan, the U.K., Russia, Romania, Germany, Canada, Turkey, the U.S., Netherlands, and Sweden.</p>\n<p>\"The operators of these Iranian cyber espionage campaigns seem to be completely unaffected by any counter-activities done by others, even though they were revealed and even stopped in the past \u2014 they simply don't stop,\" said Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point.</p>\n<p>\"These campaign operators simply learn from the past, modify their tactics, and go on to wait for a while for the storm to pass to only go at it again. Furthermore, it's worthy to note the sheer amount of resources the Iranian regime is willing to spend on exerting their control.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

One area particularly impacted last year was (and continues to be) cybersecurity. </p>\n<p>While Internet access allowed many businesses to continue functioning during the COVID-19 stay at home requirements, the unprecedented number of people accessing company assets remotely introduced many new challenges for cybersecurity professionals.</p>\n<p>With a history of leveraging societal maladies to their advantage, cyber criminals leverage the confusion and unpreparedness created by the global pandemic in their cyber attacks. </p>\n<p>In just the last two months of 2020, several high-profile organizations and government entities were successfully attacked using clever approaches that were overlooked by cybersecurity experts. Making sense of how attacks have changed and what new defensive strategies should be taken is no easy task. Cybersecurity company Cynet will help by reviewing the 2020 high profile attacks in depth and guide cybersecurity professionals for 2021 in an upcoming webinar (<a href=\"https://cynet.easywebinar.live/registration-lessons-learned-from-the-top-cyber-attacks-in-2020-and-what-to-expect-in-2021/?utm_source=thn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">register here</a>).</p>\n<p>Until then, what high profile attacks are they likely to explore?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Top 2020 Cyber Attacks</h3>\n<p>Without enough space to cover all the top attacks in 2020, several significant breaches were predominantly accomplished by new techniques.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>SolarWinds</strong></h4>\n<p>The attack involved hackers compromising the infrastructure of SolarWinds, a company that produces a network and application monitoring platform called Orion. The attackers then used that access to produce and distribute trojanized updates to the software's users, including 425 of the US Fortune 500, the top ten US telecommunications companies, the top five US accounting firms, all branches of the US Military, the Pentagon, and the State Department, as well as hundreds of universities and colleges worldwide. </p>\n<p>Cybersecurity company FireEye was successfully breached using a malware-infected update to SolarWinds Orion.</p>\n<p>An additional malware, dubbed Supernova, also used the SolarWinds Orion product as its delivery method but was likely developed and used by a different threat actor. </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Software AG</strong> </h4>\n<p>The second-largest software vendor in Germany and the seventh-largest in Europe, Software AG was reportedly hit by a Clop ransomware attack in October 2020. It was reported that the cyber-criminal gang had demanded a $23 million ransom.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Sopra Steria</strong> </h4>\n<p>Sopra Steria is a European information technology firm with 46,000 employees in 25 countries, providing a large array of IT services, including consulting, systems integration, and software development. In October 2020, Sopra Steria was attacked by what turned out to be a new version of the Ryuk ransomware, previously unknown to antivirus software providers and security agencies.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Telegram </strong></h4>\n<p>Hackers with access to the system used for connecting mobile networks across the world were able to gain access to Telegram messenger and email data of high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency business. In what is believed to be a targeted attack, the hackers were after two-factor authentication (2FA) login codes delivered over the short messaging system of the victim's mobile phone provider. </p>\n<h2>What To Expect in 2021</h2>\n<p>It will be quite interesting to hear Cynet's perspective on what will unfold over the coming year. Ransomware shows no sign of abating, and attacks on third-party suppliers to gain access to their clients' environments will undoubtedly continue. A large remote workforce likely opens companies up to traditional social engineering attacks as well.</p>\n<p>In terms of defensive actions, third party risk management will certainly be top of mind following the SolarWinds fiasco. Remote endpoints and remote workers will need to be better protected.</p>\n<p>Automated response systems will certainly gain traction as reaction times to things like ransomware must accelerate to machine speed to prevent infections from propagating across the environment and locking up critical system assets.

The hacking activity uncovered by ClearSky matched operations attributed to Hezbollah based on code overlaps between the 2015 and 2020 variants of the Explosive RAT, which is deployed onto victims' networks by exploiting known 1-day vulnerabilities in unpatched Oracle and Atlassian web servers.</p>\n<p>Using the three flaws in the servers (CVE-2019-3396, CVE-2019-11581, and CVE-2012-3152) as an attack vector to gain an initial foothold, the attackers then injected a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">web shell</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.vonloesch.de/filebrowser.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JSP file browser</a>, both of which were used to move laterally across the network, fetch additional malware, and download the Explosive RAT, which comes with capabilities to record keystrokes, capture screenshots, and execute arbitrary commands.</p>\n\n<p>\"The web shell is used to carry out various espionage operations over the attacked web server, including potential asset location for further attacks, file installation server configuration and more,\" the researchers noted, but not before obtaining escalated privileges to carry out the tasks and transmit the results to a command-and-control (C2) server.</p>\n<p>In the five years since the Explosive RAT was first seen, ClearSky said new anti-debugging features were added to the implant in its latest iteration (V4), with the communications between the compromised machine and the C2 server now encrypted.</p>\n<p>While it's not surprising for threat actors to keep a low profile, the fact that Lebanese Cedar managed to stay hidden since 2015 without attracting any attention whatsoever implies the group may have ceased operations for prolonged periods in between to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>ClearSky noted that the group's use of web shell as its primary hacking tool could have been instrumental in leading researchers to a \"dead-end in terms of attribution.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lebanese Cedar has shifted its focus significantly. Initially they attacked computers as an initial point of access, then progressed to the victim's network then further progressing (sic) to targeting vulnerable, public facing web servers,\" the researchers added.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic. </p>\n<p>\"Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low-rate loan offers and fake government emails,\" said Mark Adams, a cybersecurity analyst and subject matter expert for Springboard's new <a href=\"https://www.springboard.com/courses/cyber-security-career-track/?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hncyberattacksof2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Security Career Track</a>. \"You know, the kinds of emails that say you owe X amount in back taxes and you will be arrested if you do not respond to this email today!\" </p>\n<p>Here's a closer look at some of the biggest cyberattacks of 2020. </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Attack 1: Fraudulent unemployment claims rise in response to the pandemic </strong></h3>\n<p>Unemployment claims soared to a record high of nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/unemployment-benefits-near-record-high-almost-9-months-later.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">23 million</a> claims filed in May, shortly after most U.S. states instituted lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Two months later, the FBI reported a spike in fraudulent unemployment claims from hackers who had stolen taxpayers' personally identifiable information and filed for unemployment insurance while impersonating the victim. </p>\n<p>\"Tax scams tend to rise during tax season or during times of crisis, and scam artists are using the pandemic to try stealing money and information from honest taxpayers,\" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. </p>\n<p>Criminals steal this information in different ways, such as purchasing stolen personal data on the dark web, sending email phishing scams, cold-calling the victims in an impersonation scam by pretending to be an IRS agent or bank representative, or accessing the data from a previous data breach or computer intrusion.</p>\n<p>Each year, the IRS publishes a list called the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unveils-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams-for-2020-americans-urged-to-be-vigilant-to-these-threats-during-the-pandemic-and-its-aftermath\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dirty Dozen</a>, enumerating tax- and non-tax-related scams taxpayers should watch out for. In January, a U.S. resident was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/st-louis-resident-sentenced-prison-role-stolen-identity-fraud-scheme-claimed-12-million-tax\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">jailed </a>for using information leaked through a data breach at a payroll company to file a fraudulent tax return worth $12 million. </p>\n<p>For national security reasons, government agencies tend to be less forthcoming about data breaches than private companies, said Adams. </p>\n<p>\"If people think your agency is vulnerable then more people will try [to hack you],\" said Adams. \"It only takes one massive event to make it look like you don't have your act together.\" </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Attack 2: T-Mobile breach exposes sensitive customer data\u2014twice </strong></h3>\n<p>In December, T-Mobile revealed that it had been hacked once again, the fourth incident in three years. </p>\n<p>Companies that are repeat offenders for weak cybersecurity infrastructure often make a conscious choice to forgo extra protections because it's more cost-effective to pay the fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission in the event of a breach, according to Adams. It's unclear if T-Mobile is one of them. </p>\n<p>\"Some companies, including banks, do a cost/benefit analysis,\" he said. \"In some cases, it's cheaper to take the hit. Slap us on the wrist so we can move on.\" </p>\n<p>The first T-Mobile attack of 2020 was <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-attack/2020/t-mobile-hacked-user-data-stolen/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> in March 2020, when a cybercriminal gained access to employee email accounts and stole data on T-Mobile employees and some of its customers. For some users, \"social security numbers, financial account information and government identification numbers\" were stolen, while others simply had their account information seized. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/t-mobile-hacked----again/d/d-id/1339819\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second attack</a> was limited to what the FCC regards as \"customer proprietary network information,\" such as phone numbers, the number of lines associated with the account, and information about calls placed. T-Mobile was careful to mention that the breach affected just 0.2% of its 100 million-strong customer base, which still equates to about 200,000 people. Stealing customer metadata (information about a customer's transaction history that doesn't personally identify them) does not enable a hacker to steal your identity or seize money from your bank account, but they <em>can</em> use this information in conjunction with another scheme. </p>\n<p>For example, they can launch coordinated phishing attacks and phone scams. Social engineering refers to the practice of using verbal manipulation to coerce a victim into divulging their personal information. These methods become more convincing when a hacker has detailed information on you, such as your transaction history, making them seem like a legitimate call center representative. </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Attack 3: Hackers try to meddle with the coronavirus pandemic response</strong></h3>\n<p>In April, hackers targeted top officials who were working on the global response to the pandemic. While the World Health Organization itself wasn't hacked, employee passwords were leaked through other websites. Many of the attacks were phishing emails to lure WHO staff into clicking on a malicious link in an email that would download malware onto their device. </p>\n<p>Users of internet forum 4chan, which is now a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7aap8/the-man-who-helped-turn-4chan-into-the-internets-racist-engine\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">breeding ground</a> for alt-right groups, circulated over 2,000 passwords they claimed were linked to WHO email accounts, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-21/top-officials-at-world-health-organization-targeted-for-hacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Bloomberg</a>. Details spread to Twitter and other social media sites, where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/21/nearly-25000-email-addresses-passwords-allegedly-nih-who-gates-foundation-are-dumped-online/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">far-right political groups</a> claimed the WHO had been attacked in a bid to undermine the perceived veracity of public health guidelines. </p>\n<p>\"There is definitely a political aspect to many [cyberattacks] and they will sometimes do it to gain a political advantage or send a message to an adversary,\" said Adams. \"Or maybe it's just to put that adversary on the defensive to see how they behave.\"</p>\n<p>In another example of hackers seizing upon the pandemic zeitgeist, some <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/23-04-2020-who-reports-fivefold-increase-in-cyber-attacks-urges-vigilance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sent phishing emails</a> impersonating the WHO and urging the general public to donate to a fictitious coronavirus response fund, not the real <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Attack 4: The FireEye attack that exposed a major breach of the U.S. government</strong></h3>\n<p>When California-based cybersecurity company FireEye discovered that over 300 of its proprietary cybersecurity products had been stolen, it <a href=\"https://www.springboard.com/blog/solarwinds-hack-explainer/?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hncyberattacksof2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uncovered a massive breach </a>that had gone undetected for an estimated nine months. </p>\n<p>That breach extended to over 250 federal agencies run by the U.S. government, including the U.S. Treasury Department, Energy Department, and even parts of the Pentagon. </p>\n<p>But the breach didn't start with FireEye. The attack began when an IT management software company called SolarWinds was hacked, causing some of its most high-profile customers to be breached, including Fortune 500 corporations like Microsoft, Intel, Deloitte, and Cisco. This domino effect is known as a \"supply chain\" attack, where the infiltration of one company's cybersecurity defenses renders all of its customers vulnerable to attack. </p>\n<p>Hackers also monitored the internal emails of the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-treasury-exclsuive/suspected-russian-hackers-spied-on-u-s-treasury-emails-sources-idUKKBN28N0PG?edition-redirect=uk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Reuters</a>, which broke the news of the cyberattack in mid-December. Government officials and cybersecurity experts say that Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, known as SVR, is behind the attacks. Investigators are still piecing together the details of the breach to surmise the hacker's intentions.</p>\n<p>Software companies are prime targets for cyberattacks for two reasons. First, they're under immense pressure to release new iterations and updates ahead of their competitors, which can mean cutting corners on cybersecurity protections. </p>\n<p>\"This is something that has plagued the software industry in general for the last twenty to thirty years,\" said Adams. \"If there are delays in getting that next product or update out it just doesn't look good because that's revenue sitting on the table.\"</p>\n<p>Secondly, attacking a software company enables hackers to breach more victims than if they targeted a single company or government entity. When a software company is hacked, and the breach goes undetected, hackers need only infect a new software update or patch to breach the company's customers. When the company unwittingly ships the infected software, all of its customers who download it inadvertently install the hacker's malware onto their systems. </p>\n<p><em>With Springboard's comprehensive </em><a href=\"https://www.springboard.com/courses/cyber-security-career-track/?utm_source=thehackernews&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hncyberattacksof2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyber Security Career Track</em></a><em>, you'll work 1:1 with an industry-mentor to learn key aspects of information technology, security software, security auditing, and finding and fixing malicious code.

        "contents": "\n<p>Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.</p>\n<p>And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the year, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/us-agencies-and-fireeye-were-hacked.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">news of a massive breach</a> of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication \u2013 the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.</p>\n<p>So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach. What nobody's talking about is the rest of the 18,000 or so SolarWinds clients who may have been affected. For them, the clock is ticking to try and assess their risk of attack and to take steps to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>And because a number of the affected businesses don't have the resources of the big guys, that's a tall order right now.</p>\n<p>So, the best many companies can do to take action right now is to make their networks a bit of a harder target \u2013 or at least to minimize their chances of suffering a major breach. Here's how:</p>\n<h2>Begin with Basic Security Steps</h2>\n<p>The first thing businesses should do is make certain that their networks are as internally secure as possible. That means reconfiguring network assets to be as isolated as possible.</p>\n<p>A good place to start is to make sure that any major business data lakes follow all security best practices and remain operationally separate from one another. Doing so can limit data exfiltration if unauthorized users gain access due to a security breach. </p>\n<p>But that's just the beginning. The next step is to segment network hardware into logical security VLANS and erect firewall barriers to prevent communications between them (where possible). Then, review the security settings of each group and make adjustments where necessary. Even<a href=\"https://www.nextiva.com/blog/voip-security.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> hardening VoIP systems</a> are worth doing, as you never know what part of a network will be used as an entry point for a broader attack.</p>\n<p>And last but not least, review employee security practices and procedures. This is especially important after the rushed rollout of work-from-home policies. Make it a point to see that every employee is operating according to the established security standards and hasn't picked up any poor operational security habits. For example, did anyone<a href=\"https://vpnoverview.com/best-vpn/free-vpn/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> start using a VPN for free</a>, believing they were improving their home network security?</p>\n<p>If so, they need to stop and receive training to make better security judgments while they're still working remotely.</p>\n<h2>Conduct a Limited Security Audit</h2>\n<p>One of the problems that businesses confront when trying to re-secure after a possible network breach is that there's no easy way to tell what \u2013 if anything \u2013 the attackers changed after gaining access. To be certain, a lengthy and complex forensic examination is the only real option. But that can take months and can cost a fortune to conduct. For smaller businesses that aren't even certain that a breach even happened to them, though, there's a better approach.</p>\n<p>It's to take a limited sample of potentially affected systems and conduct a simple risk-limiting audit. Begin with at least two representative computers or devices from each business unit or department. Then, examine each for signs of an issue.</p>\n<p>In general, you would look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabled or altered security and antivirus software</li>\n<li>Unusual system log events</li>\n<li>Unexplained outgoing network connections</li>\n<li>Missing security patches or problems with automatic software updates</li>\n<li>Unknown or unapproved software installations</li>\n<li>Altered filesystem permissions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although an audit of this type won't guarantee nothing's wrong with every device on your network, it will uncover signs of any major penetration that's already taken place. For most small to medium-sized businesses, that should be enough in situations where there's no clear evidence of an active attack in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Engage in Defensive Measures</h2>\n<p>After dealing with the network and its users, the next thing to do is deploy some defensive measures to help with ongoing monitoring and attack detection. An excellent place to start is to set up a honeypot within the network to give potential attackers an irresistible target. This not only keeps them busy going after a system that's not mission-critical but also serves as an early warning system to administrators when a real attack does take place.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of ways to accomplish this, ranging from<a href=\"https://medium.com/@mr.jchens/how-to-set-up-a-honeypot-in-10-minutes-580e5d990d32\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> pre-built system images</a> all the way up to more sophisticated custom deployments. There are also<a href=\"https://analyticalsec.com/2018/12/29/setting-up-high-interaction-honeypots-on-aws/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> cloud solutions available</a> for situations where on-premises hardware is either inappropriate or undesirable. What's important is to build a system that monitors for the exact kind of behavior that would indicate a problem within its environment.</p>\n<p>A word of caution, though. Although a honeypot is built to be a target, that doesn't mean it should be left completely vulnerable. The idea is to make it an attractive target, not an easy one. And, it's crucial to make sure that it can't be used as a stepping-stone to a bigger attack on actual production systems.</p>\n<p>For that reason, it's worth it to engage the services of a trained cybersecurity professional to help make sure the system doesn't turn into a security liability instead of a valuable defensive measure.</p>\n<h2>Remain Vigilant</h2>\n<p>After taking the steps above, there's nothing more to do but wait and watch. Unfortunately, there's no better way to maintain a network's security than by remaining ever-vigilant. And in a situation like the one unleashed by the SolarWinds hack, businesses, and IT organizations, in general, are at a significant disadvantage.</p>\n<p>That's because they're facing an enemy that may or may not already be within the gates, meaning they can't fall back on typical walled-garden security approaches.</p>\n<p>So, as 2021 gets underway, the best thing any business can do is get their security house in order and try to limit the damage if they've already been breached.</p>\n<p>It's more than worth the effort in any case because the current threat environment is only going to get worse, not better. And the SolarWinds hack, as serious and wide-ranging as it is, won't be the last major security crisis businesses have to face.</p>\n<p>So, it's time to buckle up because the new decade is going to be one heck of a ride, network security-wise \u2013 and it will pay to be ready for it.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The messages also include an embedded link to retain the same password that, when clicked, redirects users to a phishing page for credential harvesting.</p>\n<p>\"The attackers target high profile employees who may not be as technically or cybersecurity savvy, and may be more likely to be deceived into clicking on malicious links,\" Trend Micro researchers <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/fake-office-365-used-for-phishing-attacks-on-c-suite-targets.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a Monday analysis.</p>\n\n<p>\"By selectively targeting C-level employees, the attacker significantly increases the value of obtained credentials as they could lead to further access to sensitive personal and organizational information, and used in other attacks.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to the researchers, the targeted email addresses were mostly collected from LinkedIn, while noting that the attackers could have purchased such target lists from marketing websites that offer CEO/CFO email and social media profile data.</p>\n<p>The Office 365 phishing kit, currently in its fourth iteration (V4), is said to have been originally released in July 2019, with additional features added to detect bot scanning or crawling attempts and provide alternative content when bots are detected. Interestingly, the alleged developer behind the malware announced V4's availability on their \"business\" Facebook page in mid-2020.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from selling the phishing kit, the actor has also been found to peddle account credentials of CEOs, chief financial officers (CFOs), finance department members, and other high-profile executives on social media pages.</p>\n<p>What's more, Trend Micro's investigation unearthed a possible link to a user handle on underground forums that was spotted selling a credential harvester tool as well as stolen C-Level account passwords anywhere between $250 to $500, echoing <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-is-selling-access-to-the-email-accounts-of-hundreds-of-c-level-executives/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous reports</a> late last year.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers uncovered at least eight compromised phishing sites hosting the V4 phishing kit, raising the possibility that they were used by different actors for a wide range of phishing campaigns directed against CEOs, presidents, board members, and founders of companies located in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Israel.</p>\n<p>\"While organizations are aware and wary of the information they include in public-facing websites and platforms, their respective employees should be constantly reminded to be mindful of the details they disclose on personal pages,\" the researchers concluded. \"These can be easily used against them for attacks using social engineering techniques.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

This response includes profile names, phone numbers, photos, and other profile related information.</p>\n\n<p>While the upload and sync contact requests are limited to 500 contacts per day, per user, and per device, Check Point researchers found a way to get around the limitation by getting hold of the device identifier, session cookies set by the server, a unique token called \"X-Tt-Token\" that's set when logging into the account with SMS and simulate the whole process from an emulator running Android 6.0.1.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that in order to request data from the TikTok application server, the HTTP requests must include X-Gorgon and X-Khronos headers for server verification, which ensures that the messages are not tampered with.</p>\n<p>But by modifying the HTTP requests \u2014 the number of contacts the attacker wants to sync \u2014 and re-signing them with an updated message signature, the flaw made it possible to automate the procedure of uploading and syncing contacts on a large scale and create a database of linked accounts and their connected phone numbers.</p>\n<p>This is far from the first time the popular video-sharing app has been found to contain security weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2020, Check Point researchers <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/tik-or-tok-is-tiktok-secure-enough/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> multiple vulnerabilities within the TikTok app that could have been exploited to get hold of user accounts and manipulate their content, including deleting videos, uploading unauthorized videos, making private \"hidden\" videos public, and revealing personal information saved on the account.</p>\n<p>Then in April, security researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk <a href=\"https://www.mysk.blog/2020/04/13/tiktok-vulnerability-enables-hackers-to-show-users-fake-videos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exposed</a> flaws in TikTok that made it possible for attackers to display forged videos, including those from verified accounts, by redirecting the app to a fake server hosting a collection of fake videos.</p>\n<p>Eventually, TikTok launched a <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/tiktok/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bug bounty partnership</a> with HackerOne last October to help users or security professionals flag technical concerns with the platform. Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS score 9 - 10) are eligible for payouts between $6,900 to $14,800, according to the program.</p>\n<p>\"Our primary motivation, this time around, was to explore the privacy of TikTok,\" said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerabilities research at Check Point. \"We were curious if the TikTok platform could be used to gain private user data. It turns out that the answer was yes, as we were able to bypass multiple protection mechanisms of TikTok that lead to privacy violation.\"</p>\n<p>\"An attacker with that degree of sensitive information could perform a range of malicious activities, such as spear phishing or other criminal actions.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Many of the records relating to the miner's configuration, its domains and IP addresses, signpost to a single point of origin: a small software company based in Iran.\"</p>\n<p>MrbMiner sets about its task by carrying out brute-force attacks against the MSSQL server's admin account with various combinations of weak passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Upon gaining access, a Trojan called \"assm.exe\" is downloaded to establish persistence, add a backdoor account for future access (username: Default, password: @fg125kjnhn987), and retrieve the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency miner payload that's run on the targeted server.</p>\n<p>Now according to Sophos, these payloads \u2014 called by various names such as sys.dll, agentx.dll, and hostx.dll, were deliberately-misnamed ZIP files, each of which contained the miner binary and a configuration file, among others.</p>\n<p>Cryptojacking attacks are typically harder to attribute given their anonymous nature, but with MrbMiner, it appears that the attackers made the mistake of hardcoding the payload location and the command-and-control (C2) address into the downloader.</p>\n\n<p>One of the domains in question, \"<a href=\"https://threatintelligence.guardicore.com/ip/62.102.130.128\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vihansoft[.]ir,</a>\" was not only registered to the Iranian software development company but the compiled miner binary included in the payload left telltale signs that connected the malware to a now-shuttered GitHub account that was used to host it.</p>\n<p>While database servers, owing to their powerful processing capabilities, are a lucrative target for cybercriminals looking to distribute cryptocurrency miners, the development adds to growing concerns that heavily-sanctioned countries like North Korea and Iran are using cryptocurrency as a means to evade penalties designed to isolate them and to facilitate illicit activities.</p>\n<p>\"Cryptojacking is a silent and invisible threat that is easy to implement and very difficult to detect,\" Szappanos said. \"Further, once a system has been compromised it presents an open door for other threats, such as ransomware.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is therefore important to stop cryptojacking in its tracks. Look out for signs such as a reduction in computer speed and performance, increased electricity use, devices overheating and increased demands on the CPU.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

and avoid detection, as cybersecurity companies work towards getting a \"clearer picture\" of one of the most sophisticated attacks in recent history.</p>\n<p>Calling the threat actor \"skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices,\" the company said the attackers went out of their way to ensure that the initial backdoor (<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/us-agencies-and-fireeye-were-hacked.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sunburst</a> aka Solorigate) and the post-compromise implants (<a

their malicious activity.</p>\n<p>\"The attackers behind Solorigate are skilled campaign operators who carefully planned and executed the attack, remaining elusive while maintaining persistence,\" researchers from Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), and Microsoft Cyber Defense Operations Center (CDOC) <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the exact identity of the group tracked as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/microsoft-warns-crowdstrike-of-hackers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">StellarParticle</a> (CrowdStrike), UNC2452 (FireEye), <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SolarStorm</a>

(Volexity) remains unknown as yet, the U.S. government earlier this month formally tied the espionage campaign to a group likely of Russian origin.</p>\n<h3>A Variety of Tactics to Stay Undetected</h3>\n<p>Microsoft's <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/unveiled-sunspot-malware-was-used-to.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">timeline</a> of the attacks shows that the fully-functional Sunburst DLL backdoor was compiled and deployed onto SolarWinds' Orion platform on February 20, following which it was distributed in the form of tampered updates sometime in late March.</p>\n\n<p>An almost two-month-long reconnaissance period to profile its targets \u2014 something that requires a stealthy persistence to remain undetected and collect valuable information \u2014 ultimately paved the way for the deployment of Cobalt Strike implants on selected victim networks in May and the removal of Sunburst from SolarWinds build environment on June 4.</p>\n<p>But answers as to how and when the transition from Sunburst to Raindrop occurs have yielded little definitive clues, even if it appears that the attackers deliberately separated the Cobalt Strike loader's execution from the SolarWinds process as an OpSec measure.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that in the event the Cobalt Strike implants were discovered on target networks, it wouldn't reveal the compromised SolarWinds binary and the supply chain attack that led to its deployment in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The findings also make it clear that, while the hackers relied on an array of attack vectors, the trojanized SolarWinds software formed the core of the espionage operation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methodic avoidance of shared indicators for each compromised host by deploying custom Cobalt Strike DLL implants on each system</li>\n<li>Camouflaging malicious tools and binaries to mimic existing files and programs already present on the compromised machine</li>\n<li>Disabling event logging using AUDITPOL before <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/28/using-microsoft-365-defender-to-coordinate-protection-against-solorigate/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hands-on keyboard activity</a> and enabling it back once complete</li>\n<li>Creating special firewall rules to minimize outgoing packets for certain protocols before running noisy network enumeration activities that were later removed after the network survey</li>\n<li>Executing lateral movement activities only after disabling security services on targeted hosts</li>\n<li>Allegedly using timestomping to change artifacts' timestamps and leveraging wiping procedures and tools to prevent discovery of malicious DLL implants</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adopting a Zero Trust Mentality</h3>\n<p>\"This attack was simultaneously sophisticated and ordinary,\" Microsoft said. \"The actor demonstrated sophistication in the breadth of tactics used to penetrate, expand across, and persist in affected infrastructure, but many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) were individually ordinary.\"</p>\n<p>To protect against such attacks in the future, the company recommends that organizations adopt a \"<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/19/using-zero-trust-principles-to-protect-against-sophisticated-attacks-like-solorigate/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">zero trust mentality</a>\" to achieve least privileged access and minimize risks by enabling multi-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>\"With Solorigate, the attackers took advantage of broad role assignments, permissions that exceeded role requirements, and in some cases abandoned accounts and applications which should have had no permissions at all,\" Alex Weinert, Microsoft's director of identity security, said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Here, the entire public had access to the information stolen.\"</p>\n<p>\"The strategy of the attackers was to store stolen information on a specific webpage that they created. That way, after the phishing campaigns ran for a certain time, the attackers can scan the compromised servers for the respective webpages, collecting credentials to steal. The attackers didn't think that if they are able to scan the Internet for those pages \u2014 Google can too. This was a clear operation security failure for the attackers.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

A second attack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait PDF documents that purported to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.</p>\n\n<p>The shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for designers and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a shellcode loader (\"svchast.exe\") and a backdoor called <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.crosswalk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crosswalk</a> (\"3t54dE3r.tmp\").</p>\n<p>Crosswalk, first documented by FireEye in 2017, is a bare-bones modular backdoor capable of carrying out system reconnaissance and receiving additional modules from an attacker-controlled server as shellcode.</p>\n\n<p>While this modus operandi shares <a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/higaisa/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similarities</a> with that of the Korean threat group Higaisa \u2014 which was found <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/return-higaisa-apt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exploiting LNK files</a> attached in an email to launch attacks on unsuspecting victims in 2020 \u2014 the researchers said the use of Crosswalk suggests the involvement of Winnti.</p>\n<p>This is also supported by the fact that the network infrastructure of the samples overlaps with previously known APT41 infrastructure, with some of the domains traced back to <a href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Winnti attacks</a> on the online video game industry in 2013.</p>\n<p>The new wave of attacks is no different. Notably, among the targets include Battlestate Games, a Unity3D game developer from St. Petersburg.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the researchers found additional attack samples in the form of RAR files that contained Cobalt Strike Beacon as the payload, with the hackers in one case referencing the U.S. protests related to the death of George Floyd last year as a lure.</p>\n\n<p>In another instance, Compromised certificates belonging to a Taiwanese company called Zealot Digital were abused to strike organizations in Hong Kong with Crosswalk and Metasploit injectors, as well as <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.shadowpad\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ShadowPad</a>, Paranoid PlugX, and a new .NET backdoor called FunnySwitch.</p>\n\n<p>The backdoor, which appears to be still under development, is capable of collecting system information and running arbitrary JScript code. It also shares a number of common features with Crosswalk, leading the researchers to believe that they were written by the same developers.</p>\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-paranoid-plugx/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Paranoid PlugX</a> had been linked to attacks on companies in the video games industry in 2017. Thus, the deployment of the malware via Winnti's network infrastructure adds credence to the \"relationship\" between the two groups.</p>\n<p>\"Winnti continues to pursue game developers and publishers in Russia and elsewhere,\" the researchers concluded. \"Small studios tend to neglect information security, making them a tempting target. Attacks on software developers are especially dangerous for the risk they pose to end users, as already happened in the well-known cases of CCleaner and ASUS.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

But the app was found to leverage the API of a legitimate chat service called ChatGum.</p>\n\n<p>Once installed, the app requests intrusive permissions, including the ability to access contacts, file system, location, microphone, and read SMS messages, which allow it to gather a wide swathe of data on a victim's device.</p>\n<p>All these apps have one singular purpose \u2014 to conduct covert surveillance and exfiltrate the data from a target device. In addition to sending the unique IMEI identifier, the DEX payload relays detailed profile information about the phone, location information, contact lists, the contents of text messages, call logs and the full directory listing of any internal or SD card storage on the device.</p>\n<p>Troublingly, the malicious Pakistan Citizen Portal app also transmits sensitive information such as users' computerized national identity card (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerised_National_Identity_Card\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNIC</a>) numbers, their passport details, and the username and password for Facebook and other accounts.</p>\n<p>\"The spying and covert surveillance capability of these modified Android apps highlight the dangers of spyware to smartphone users everywhere,\" Pankaj Kohli said. \"Cyber-adversaries target mobiles not just to get their hands on sensitive and personal information, but because they offer a real-time window into people's lives, their physical location, movements, and even live conversations taking place within listening range of the infected phone.\"</p>\n\n<p>If anything, the development is yet another reason why users need to stick to trusted sources to download third-party apps, verify if an app is indeed built by a genuine developer, and carefully scrutinize app permissions before installation.</p>\n<p>\"In the current Android ecosystem, apps are cryptographically signed as a way to certify the code originates with a legitimate source, tying the app to its developer,\" the researchers concluded. \"However, Android doesn't do a good job exposing to the end user when a signed app's certificate isn't legitimate or doesn't validate. As such, users have no easy way of knowing if an app was indeed published by its genuine developer.\"</p>\n<p>\"This allows threat actors to develop and publish fake versions of popular apps. The existence of a large number of app stores, and the freedom of users to install an app from practically anywhere makes it even harder to combat such threats.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

backdoor on target systems.</p>\n<p>\"The investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been

rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> on Friday in a post detailing the Sunburst malware.</p>\n<p>What makes the newly revealed malware, dubbed \"Supernova,\" different is that unlike the Sunburst DLL, <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c15abaf51e78ca56c0376522d699c978217bf041a3bd3c71d09193efa5717c71/detection\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supernova</a>

rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 companies</a> and government agencies \u2014 had been executed with a far broader scope and extraordinary sophistication.</p>\n<p>The adversaries used what's called a supply chain attack, exploiting SolarWinds Orion network management software updates the company distributed between March and June of this year to plant malicious code in a DLL file (aka Sunburst or Solorigate) on the targets' servers that's capable of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/additional-analysis-into-the-sunburst-backdoor/\" rel=\"noopener\"

operandi has also revealed that the campaign chose to steal data only from a select few of thousands of victims, opting to escalate their attacks based on intel amassed during an initial reconnaissance of the target environment for high-value accounts and assets.</p>\n\n<p>The escalation involves the predefined command-and-control (C2) server \u2014 a now-sinkholed domain called

The ultimate goal of the attackers remains unclear as well, what with little to no information about the post-compromise activity.</p>\n\n<p>If anything, the incident highlights why supply-chain attacks are increasingly becoming a common attack vector among cyberespionage groups, as it allows the adversaries to deploy malware on many computers at the same time covertly.</p>\n\n<p>In November, ESET disclosed a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/11/trojanized-security-software-hits-south.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lazarus campaign</a> in South Korea that used legitimate security software and stolen digital certificates to distribute remote administration tools (RATs) on target systems.</p>\n<p>Then last week, it also found that a chat software called Able Desktop, used by 430 government agencies in Mongolia, was <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abused</a> to deliver the HyperBro backdoor, the Korplug RAT, and another Trojan called Tmanger.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a supply-chain attack on <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/new-evidence-suggests-solarwinds.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SolarWinds Orion software</a> discovered this week was exploited to breach several major US government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Treasury, and State.</p>\n<p>\"Supply-chain attacks are typically hard to find, as the malicious code is generally hidden among a lot of legitimate code, making its discovery significantly more difficult,\" Faou concluded.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>A security researcher has demonstrated that sensitive data could be exfiltrated from air-gapped computers via a novel technique that leverages Wi-Fi signals as a covert channel\u2014surprisingly, without requiring the presence of Wi-Fi hardware on the targeted systems.</p>\n<p>Dubbed \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06884\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AIR-FI</a>,\" the attack hinges on deploying a specially designed malware in a compromised system that exploits \"DDR SDRAM buses to generate electromagnetic emissions in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi bands\" and transmitting information atop these frequencies that can then be intercepted and decoded by nearby Wi-Fi capable devices such as smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices before sending the data to remote servers controlled by an attacker.</p>\n<p>The findings were published today in a paper titled \"AIR-FI: Generating Covert Wi-Fi Signals from Air-Gapped Computers\" by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mordechai-guri-081109100/?originalSubdomain=il\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Mordechai Guri</a>, the head of R&amp;D at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev's Cyber-Security Research Center, Israel.</p>\n\n<p>\"The AIR-FI attack [...] does not require Wi-Fi related hardware in the air-gapped computers,\" Dr. Guri outlined. \"Instead, an attacker can exploit the DDR SDRAM buses to generate electromagnetic emissions in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi bands and encode binary data on top of it.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Guri, earlier this May, also demonstrated <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/air-gap-malware-power-speaker.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">POWER-SUPPLaY</a>, a separate mechanism that allows the malware to exploit a computer's power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and use it as an out-of-band, secondary speaker to leak data.</p>\n<p>Air-gapped computers \u2014 machines with no network interfaces \u2014 are considered a necessity in environments where sensitive data is involved in an attempt to reduce the risk of data leakage.</p>\n\n<p>Thus in order to carry out attacks against such systems, it is often essential that the transmitting and receiving machines be located in close physical proximity to one another and that they are infected with the appropriate malware to establish the communication link.</p>\n<p>But AIR-FI is unique in that the method neither relies on a Wi-Fi transmitter to generate signals nor requires kernel drivers, special privileges such as root, or access to hardware resources to transmit the data.</p>\n<p>What's more, the covert channel works even from within an isolated virtual machine and has an endless list of Wi-Fi enabled devices that can be hacked by an attacker to act as a potential receiver.</p>\n\n<p>The kill chain in itself consists of an air-gapped computer onto which the malware is deployed via social engineering lures, self-propagating worms such as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/gmail-malware-hacker.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Agent.BTZ</a>, tampered USB flash drives, or even with the help of malicious insiders.</p>\n<p>It also requires infecting Wi-Fi capable devices co-located in the air-gapped network by compromising the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2664243.2664260\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">firmware of the Wi-Fi chips</a> to install malware capable of detecting and decoding the AIR-FI transmission and exfiltrating the data over the Internet.</p>\n<p>With this setup in place, the malware on the target system collects the relevant data (e.g., confidential documents, credentials, encryption keys), which is then encoded and transmitted in the Wi-Fi band at 2.4 GHz frequency using the electromagnetic emissions generated from the DDR SDRAM buses used to exchange data between the CPU and the memory, thus defeating air-gap isolation.</p>\n\n<p>To generate the Wi-Fi signals, the attack makes use of the data bus (or memory bus) to emit electromagnetic radiation at a frequency correlated to the DDR memory module and the memory read/write operations executed by processes currently running in the system.</p>\n<p>AIR-FI was evaluated using four types of workstations with different RAM and hardware configurations as well as a software-defined radio (SDR) and a USB Wi-Fi network adapter that functioned as the receiver, finding that the covert channel can be effectively maintained at distances up to several meters from air-gapped computers and achieving bit rates ranging from 1 to 100 bit/sec, depending on the type and mode of receiver used.</p>\nlinkads\n<p>If anything, the new research is yet another reminder that <a href=\"https://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">electromagnetic, acoustic, thermal, and optical</a> components continue to be lucrative vectors to mount sophisticated exfiltration attacks against air-gapped facilities.</p>\n<p>As a countermeasure, Dr. Guri proposes zone protections to safeguard against electromagnetic attacks, enabling intrusion detection systems to monitor and inspect for processes that perform intensive memory transfer operations, jamming the signals, and using Faraday shields to block the covert channel.</p>\n<p>The AIR-FI malware shows \"how attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers to a nearby Wi-Fi receiver via Wi-Fi signals,\" he added.</p>\n<p>\"Modern IT environments are equipped with many types of Wi-Fi capable devices: smartphones, laptops, IoT devices, sensors, embedded systems, and smart watches, and other wearables devices. The attacker can potentially hack such equipment to receive the AIR-FI transmissions from air-gapped computers.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Upon execution, it proceeds to terminate security software, trigger encryption using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha20_adoption\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ChaCha20</a> cipher, and create a ransom note, which contains a link to a Tor .onion URL to contact the criminals via a \"dark web\" chat service to negotiate a price for decrypting software.</p>\n\n<p>It also uses an embedded RSA-2048 public key to encrypt the encryption key, deletes volume shadow copies to thwart restoration of the encrypted files, and eventually removes itself from the disk to hide its tracks.</p>\n<p>The researchers, however, point out that the ransomware uses a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/sdl/cryptographic-recommendations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cryptographically insecure</a> method called <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-gettickcount\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GetTickCount</a> API for key generation that may be susceptible to a brute-force attack.</p>\n<p>MountLocker's list of encryption targets is extensive, with support for over 2600 file extensions spanning databases, documents, archives, images, accounting software, security software, source code, games, and backups. Executable files such as .exe, .dll, and .sys are left untouched.</p>\n<p>That's not all. A new variant of MountLocker spotted in late November (dubbed \"version 2\") goes a step further by dropping the list of extensions to be included for encryption in favor of a lean exclusion list: .exe, .dll, .sys, .msi, .mui, .inf, .cat, .bat, .cmd, .ps1, .vbs, .ttf, .fon, and .lnk.</p>\n<p>\"Since its inception, the MountLocker group has been seen to both expand and improve their services and malware,\" the researchers concluded. \"While their current capabilities are not particularly advanced, we expect this group to continue developing and growing in prominence over the short term.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\n<p>Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed details of a previously undiscovered in-memory Windows backdoor developed by a hacker-for-hire operation that can execute remotely malicious code and steal sensitive information from its targets in Asia, Europe, and the US.</p>\n<p>Dubbed \"<a href=\"https://securelist.com/what-did-deathstalker-hide-between-two-ferns/99616/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PowerPepper</a>\" by Kaspersky researchers, the malware has been attributed to the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeathStalker</a> group (formerly called Deceptikons), a threat actor that has been found to hit law firms and companies in the financial sector located in Europe and the Middle East at least since 2012.</p>\n<p>The hacking tool is so-called because of its reliance on steganographic trickery to deliver the backdoor payload in the form of an image of ferns or peppers.</p>\n<p>The espionage group first came to light <a href=\"https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this July</a>, with most of their attacks starting with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious modified LNK (shortcut) file that, when clicked, downloads and runs a PowerShell-based implant named Powersing.</p>\n\n<p>While their objectives don't appear to be financially motivated, their continued interest in collecting crucial business information led Kaspersky to the conclusion that \"DeathStalker is a group of mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services, or acting as some sort of information broker in financial circles.\"</p>\n<p>PowerPepper now joins the group's list of expanding and evolving toolsets.</p>\n<p>Spotted in the wild in mid-July 2020, this new strain of malware gets dropped from a decoy Word document and leverages DNS over HTTPS (DoH) as a communications channel to transmit encrypted malicious shell commands from an attacker-controlled server.</p>\n<p>The spear-phishing emails come with themes as varied as carbon emission regulations, travel booking, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with the Word documents having social engineering banners urging users to enable macros in a bid to lure an unsuspecting user into downloading the backdoor.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve its goals, the implant sends DNS requests to name servers \u2014 servers that store the DNS records \u2014 associated with a malicious C2 domain, which then sends back the command to be run in the form of an embedded response. Upon execution, the results are beamed to the server through a batch of DNS requests.</p>\n<p>Besides leveraging macro-based and LNK-based delivery chains to deploy the malware, DeathStalker employed \"obfuscation, execution and masquerading tricks to hinder detection, or deceive targets that are curious about what is happening on their computers,\" Kaspersky's Pierre Delcher noted.</p>\n<p>Chief among them are the capabilities to hide malicious execution workflow in Word embedded shape and object properties and use Windows Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files as archives for malicious files.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple mercenary groups have been seen in the wild before, including <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massive-hack-for-hire-operation/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BellTroX</a> (aka Dark Basin), <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-uncovers-massive-hack-for-hire-group-targeting-governments-businesses-human-rights-groups-and-influential-individuals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bahamut</a>, and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/11/uncovered-apt-hackers-for-hire-target.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CostaRicto</a>, all of whom have deployed custom malware to breach systems belonging to financial institutions and government officials.</p>\n<p>\"It only seems fair to write that DeathStalker tried hard to develop evasive, creative and intricate tools with this PowerPepper implant and associated delivery chains,\" Delcher concluded.</p>\n<p>\"There is nothing particularly sophisticated about the techniques and tricks that are leveraged, yet the whole toolset has proved to be effective, is pretty well put together, and shows determined efforts to compromise various targets around the world.\"</p>\n<p>To safeguard against PowerPepper delivery and execution, it is recommended that businesses and users update their CMS backends as well as associated plugins, restrict PowerShell use on end-user computers with enforced execution policies, and refrain from opening Windows shortcuts attached to emails, or click links in emails from unknown senders.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Because UEFI facilitates the loading of the operating system itself, such infections are resistant to OS reinstallation or replacement of the hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>TrickBot emerged in 2016 as a banking trojan but has since evolved into a multi-purpose malware-as-a-service (MaaS) that infects systems with other malicious payloads designed to steal credentials, email, financial data, and spread file-encrypting ransomware such as Conti and Ryuk.</p>\n<p>Its <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/trickbot-linux-variants-active-in-wild.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modularity and versatility</a> have made it an ideal tool for a diverse set of threat actors despite attempts by cyber vendors to <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/trickbot-computer-virus.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">take the infrastructure down</a>. It has also been observed in conjunction with Emotet campaigns to deploy Ryuk ransomware.</p>\n\n<p>\"Their most common attack chain largely begins via Emotet malspam campaigns, which then loads TrickBot and/or other loaders, and moves to attack tools like PowerShell Empire or Cobalt Strike to accomplish objectives relative to the victim organization under attack,\" the researchers said. \"Often, at the end of the kill-chain, either Conti or Ryuk ransomware is deployed.\"</p>\n<p>To date, the botnet has infected more than a million computers, according to Microsoft and its partners at Symantec, ESET, FS-ISAC, and Lumen.</p>\n<h3>From a Reconnaissance Module to an Attack Function</h3>\n<p>The newest addition to their arsenal suggests that TrickBot can not only be used to target systems en masse with ransomware and UEFI attacks but also provide criminal actors even more leverage during ransom negotiation by leaving a covert UEFI bootkit on the system for later use.</p>\n<p>The development is also <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/uefi-bootkit-malware.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">yet another sign</a> that adversaries are extending their focus beyond the operating system of the device to lower layers to avoid detection and carry out destructive or espionage-focused campaigns.</p>\n<p>TrickBot's reconnaissance component, observed for the first time in October 2020 right after the take-down attempts orchestrated by the US Cyber Command and Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/persist-brick-profit-trickbot-offers-new-trickboot-uefi-focused-functionality\">targets</a> Intel-based systems from Skylake through Comet Lake chipsets to probe for vulnerabilities in the UEFI firmware of the infected machines.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the researchers found that TrickBoot takes aim at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface\">SPI</a> flash chip that houses the UEFI/BIOS firmware, using an obfuscated copy of <a href=\"https://rweverything.com/\">RWEverything</a> tool's RwDrv.sys driver to check if the BIOS control register is unlocked and the contents of the BIOS region can be modified.</p>\n\n<p>Although the activity is limited to reconnaissance so far, it wouldn't be a stretch if this capability is extended to write malicious code to the system firmware, thereby ensuring that attacker code executes before the operating system and paving the way for the installation of backdoors, or even the destruction of a targeted device.</p>\n<p>What's more, given the size and scope of the TrickBot, an attack of this kind can have severe consequences.</p>\n<p>\"TrickBoot is only one line of code away from being able to brick any device it finds to be vulnerable,\" the researchers noted. \"The national security implications arising from a widespread malware campaign capable of bricking devices is enormous.\"</p>\n<p>With UEFI persistence, \"TrickBot operators can disable any OS level security controls they want, which then allows them to re-surface to a modified OS with neutered endpoint protections and carry out objectives with unhurried time on their side.\"</p>\n<p>To mitigate such threats, it's recommended that the firmware is kept up-to-date, <a href=\"https://eclypsium.com/2019/10/23/protecting-system-firmware-storage/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BIOS write protections</a> are enabled, and firmware integrity is verified to safeguard against unauthorized modifications.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

During the initial setup phase, the client sends \"c2_command 0\" to the server along with information about the compromised system and the bot ID, which then responds with the message \"signal /1/\" back to the bot.</p>\n\n<p>As an acknowledgment, the bot sends the same message back to the C2, following which the server remotely issues the command to be executed on the client. In the last step, the bot sends back the result of the execution to the C2 server.</p>\n<p>\"Every part of communication made to the C2 follows a sequence of 3 different DNS queries,\" Netscout security researcher Suweera De Souza said.</p>\n\n<p>The result of the third query is a list of IP addresses that are subsequently parsed by the client to build the executable payload.</p>\n<p>The last piece of data sent by the C2 server corresponds to a range of commands (numbered 0-14 in Windows, and 0-4, 10-12, and 100 in Linux) for the bot to execute the payload via cmd.exe or by injecting it into multiple running processes such as Windows File Explorer or Notepad.</p>\n<p>\"The complexity of Anchor's C2 communication and the payloads that the bot can execute reflect not only a portion of the Trickbot actors' considerable capabilities, but also their ability to constantly innovate, as evidenced by their move to Linux,\" De Souza said. </p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

For example, if C2 sends 0, then it collects the Computer Name, Username, OS version etc. and sends it back to C2.\"</p>\n\n<p>Stating the RAT shared code-level similarities with Allakore Remote, an open-sourced remote-access software written in Delphi, Quick Heal's Seqrite team noted that the Trojan employed Allakore's RFB (remote frame buffer) protocol to exfiltrate data from the infected system.</p>\n<h3>Possible Links to Transparent Tribe APT</h3>\n<p>In addition, a few attack chains are also said to have dropped a previously unseen .NET-based RAT (called \"Crimson RAT\" by <a href=\"https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part-1/98127/\">Kaspersky</a> researchers) that comes equipped with a wide range of capabilities, including access files, clipboard data, kill processes, and even execute arbitrary commands.</p>\n<p>Although the modus operandi of naming DLL files shares similarities with the SideWinder group, the APT's heavy reliance on the open-sourced toolset and an entirely different C2 infrastructure led the researchers to conclude with <a href=\"https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part-2/98233/\">reasonable confidence</a> that the threat actor is of Pakistani origin \u2014 specifically the <a href=\"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major\">Transparent Tribe</a> group, which has been recently linked to several attacks targeting the Indian military and government personnel.</p>\n<p>\"Thus, we suspect that the actor behind this operation is a sub-division under (or part of) Transparent-Tribe APT group and are just copying TTPs of other threat actors to mislead the security community,\" Quick Heal said.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

by the country's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) for carrying out malware campaigns targeting Iranian dissidents, journalists, and international companies in the telecom and travel sectors.<p></p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the sanctions target Rana Intelligence Computing Company (or Rana), which the agencies said operated as a front for the threat group <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087/\">APT39</a> (aka Chafer or Remix Kitten), Iranian cyber espionage hacking collective active since 2014 known for its attacks on companies in the U.S. and the Middle East with an aim to pilfer personal information and advance Iran's national security objectives.</p>\n<p>To that effect, 45 individuals who served in various capacities while employed at the front company, including as managers, programmers, and hacking experts, have been implicated in the sanctions, which also prohibit U.S. companies from doing business with Rana and its employees.</p>\n\n<p>\"Masked behind its front company, Rana Intelligence Computing Company (Rana), the Government of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) has employed a years-long malware campaign that targeted and monitored Iranian citizens, dissidents, and journalists, the government networks of Iran's neighboring countries, and foreign organizations in the travel, academic, and telecommunications sectors,\" the FBI <a

is also believed to have targeted Iranian private sector companies and academic institutions, including Persian language and cultural centers inside and outside the country.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<h3>APT39's Long History of Espionage Activities</h3>\n<p>APT39 has a history of hacking into targets spanning over 30 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, and at least 15 U.S. companies in the travel sector have been compromised by Rana's malware, using the unauthorized access to track the movements of individuals whom MOIS considered a threat.</p>\n<p>Earlier this May, Bitdefender <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/iran-hackers-kuwait.html\">uncovered</a> two cyberattacks directed against critical infrastructures in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, compromising its victims via spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments and using various intrusion tools to gain an initial foothold and collect sensitive data from infected systems.</p>\n<p>Aside from formally connecting the activities of APT39 to Rana, the FBI detailed eight separate and distinct sets of <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/media/news/2020/200917-2.pdf\">previously undisclosed malware</a> used by the group to conduct their computer intrusion and reconnaissance activities, which comprises of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Office documents laced with Visual Basic Script (VBS) malware sent via social engineering techniques</li>\n<li>Malicious AutoIt malware scripts embedded in Microsoft Office documents or malicious links</li>\n<li>Two different versions of BITS malware to aggregate and exfiltrate victim data to an actor-controlled infrastructure</li>\n<li>A screenshot and keylogger utility that masqueraded as legitimate Mozilla Firefox browser</li>\n<li>A Python-based downloader to fetch additional malicious files to the victim machine from a command-and-control (C2) server</li>\n<li>An Android implant (\"optimizer.apk\") with information-stealing and remote access capabilities</li>\n<li>\"Depot.dat\" malware for collecting screenshots and capturing keystrokes and transmitting the information to a remote server under their control</li>\n</ul>\n<br/><br/>\n<h3>A Series of Charges Against Iranian Hackers</h3>\n<p>The sanctions against APT39 is the latest in a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/soleimani-website-hacking.html\">string</a> of <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/us-announces-charges-against-2-russian.html\">actions</a> undertaken

Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to steal critical information related to U.S. aerospace and satellite technology companies.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, the Cybersecurity Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of an Iran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several U.S. federal agencies by exploiting <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/09/15/iran-based-threat-actor-exploits-vpn-vulnerabilities\">unpatched VPN vulnerabilities</a> to amass sensitive data and even sell access to the compromised network infrastructure in an online hacker forum.</p>\n\n<p>\"This week's unsealing of indictments and other disruptive actions serves as another reminder of the breadth and depth of Iranian malicious cyber activities targeting not only the United States, but countries all over the world,\" John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-and-partner-departments-and-agencies-conduct-coordinated-actions-disrupt\">said</a> in a statement.</p>\n<p>\"Whether directing such hacking activities, or by offering a safe haven for Iranian criminal hackers, Iran is complicit in the targeting of innocent victims worldwide and is deepening its status as a rogue state.\"</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Demers in a statement. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe defendants, from Iran and Palestine, respectively, are now wanted by the US authorities and are no longer free to travel outside their countries without risking an arrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Abusrour and Mohammadzadeh have been behind a defacing spree individually on their own over the last couple of years, they began to work together starting last December, before stepping up their attacks on January 3, a day after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani\" target=\"_blank\">US forces killed Qassem Soleimani</a> in a drone airstrike near Baghdad International Airport. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith help from Abusrour, who provided Mohammadzadeh with access to compromised websites, the latter went on to hack into at least 51 websites in the US by replacing their content with pictures of the late general against a background of the Iranian flag along with the message \"Down with America,\" alongside \"Suleimani was not a person/he was a belief/Beliefs never die.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nIn addition, visitors of the defaced websites were directed to Mohammadzadeh's Telegram and public Instagram account, which subsequently redirected users to <a href=\"https://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=Mrb3hz4d\" target=\"_blank\">Zone-H</a>, a security portal that holds an archive of all web intrusions, linking the exploits to his pseudonym \"Mrb3hz4d.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe indictment also highlighted a screenshot of the messages shared between the two individuals and posted on Abusrour's Instagram account that revealed the list of seven websites that were broken into, and noted that the hackers posted the results of their work on social media and other online accounts in order to publicize their defacements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two hackers have now been charged and risk sentences of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000, if found guilty, according to the DoJ.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Foreign hackers are a persistent commercial and national security threat to the United States,\" said US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. \"Working with our law enforcement partners worldwide, we will aggressively pursue, prosecute and apprehend those who use the internet to attack American interests.\"\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The loophole, however, doesn't impact Mastercard, American Express, and JCB.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe findings will be presented at the 42nd IEEE Symposium on <a href=\"https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Security and Privacy</a> to be held in San Francisco next May.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>\nModifying Card Transaction Qualifiers Via MitM Attack</h2>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV\" target=\"_blank\">EMV</a> (short for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa), the widely used international protocol standard for smartcard payment, necessitates that larger amounts can only be debited from credit cards with a PIN code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nBut the setup devised by ETH researchers exploits a critical flaw in the protocol to mount a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack via an Android app that \"instructs the terminal that PIN verification is not required because the cardholder verification was performed on the consumer's device.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue stems from the fact the Cardholder verification method (CVM), which is used to verify whether an individual attempting a transaction with a credit or debit card is the legitimate cardholder, is not cryptographically protected from modification.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nAs a result, the Card Transaction Qualifiers (CTQ) used to determine what CVM check, if any, is required for the transaction can be modified to inform the PoS terminal to override the PIN verification and that the verification was carried out using the cardholder's device such as a smartwatch or smartphone (called Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method or CDCVM).<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>\nExploiting Offline Transactions Without Being Charged</h2>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, the researchers uncovered a second vulnerability, which involves offline contactless transactions carried out by either a Visa or an old Mastercard card, allowing the attacker to alter a specific piece of data called \"Application Cryptogram\" (AC) before it is delivered to the terminal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffline cards are typically used to directly pay for goods and services from a cardholder's bank account without requiring a PIN number. But since these transactions are not connected to an online system, there is a delay of 24 to 72 hours before the bank confirms the transaction's legitimacy using the cryptogram, and the amount of the purchase is debited from the account.<br/>\n<br/>\nA criminal can leverage this delayed processing mechanism to use their card to complete a low-value and offline transaction without being charged, in addition to making away with purchases by the time the issuing bank declines the transaction due to the wrong cryptogram.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"This constitutes a 'free lunch' attack in that the criminal can purchase low-value goods or services without actually being charged at all,\" the researchers said, adding the low-value nature of these transactions is unlikely to be an \"attractive business model for criminals.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>\nMitigating PIN bypass and offline attacks</h2>\n<br/>\nAside from notifying Visa of the flaws, the researchers have also proposed three software fixes to the protocol to prevent PIN bypass and offline attacks, including using Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) to secure high-value online transactions and requiring the <a href=\"https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/contactless/\" target=\"_blank\">use of online cryptogram</a> in all PoS terminals, which causes offline transactions to be processed online.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Our attack show[ed] that the PIN is useless for Visa contactless transactions [and] revealed surprising differences between the security of the contactless payment protocols of Mastercard and Visa, showing that Mastercard is more secure than Visa,\" the researchers concluded. \"These flaws violate fundamental security properties such as authentication and other guarantees about accepted transactions.\"\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nCybersecurity researchers have discovered critical vulnerabilities in industrial VPN implementations primarily used to provide remote access to operational technology (OT) networks that could allow hackers to overwrite data, execute malicious code, and compromise industrial control systems (ICS).<br/>\n<br/>\nA new report <a href=\"https://www.claroty.com/2020/07/28/vpn-security-flaws/\">published</a> by industrial cybersecurity company Claroty demonstrates multiple severe vulnerabilities in enterprise-grade VPN installations, including Secomea GateManager M2M Server, Moxa EDR-G902, and EDR-G903, and HMS Networks eWon's eCatcher VPN client.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese vulnerable products are widely used in field-based industries such as oil and gas, water utilities, and electric utilities to remotely access, maintain and monitor ICS and field devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and input/output devices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Claroty researchers, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can give an unauthenticated attacker direct access to the ICS devices and potentially cause some physical damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Secomean's GateManager, researchers uncovered multiple security flaws, including a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-14500) that allows overwriting arbitrary data, executing arbitrary code, or causing a DoS condition, running commands as root, and obtaining user passwords due to the use of a weak hash type.<br/>\n<br/>\nGateManager is a widely used ICS remote access server deployed worldwide as a cloud-based SaaS solution that allows users to connect to the internal network from the internet through an encrypted tunnel while avoiding server setups.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe critical flaw, identified as CVE-2020-14500, affects the GateManager component, the main routing instance in the Secomea remote access solution. The flaw occurs due to improper handling of some of the HTTP request headers provided by the client.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis flaw can be exploited remotely and without requiring any authentication to achieve remote code execution, which could result in gaining full access to a customer's internal network, along with the ability to decrypt all traffic that passes through the VPN.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Moxa EDR-G902 and EDR-G903 industrial VPN servers, researchers discovered a stack-based buffer overflow bug (CVE-2020-14511) in the system web server that can be triggered just by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, eventually allowing attackers to carry out remote code execution without the need for any credentials.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaroty researchers also tested HMS Networks' eCatcher, a proprietary VPN client that connects to the company's eWon VPN device, and found that the product is vulnerable to a critical stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14498) that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll an attacker needs to do is tricking victims into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious email containing a specifically crafted HTML element that triggers the flaw in eCatcher, eventually allowing attackers to take complete control of the targeted machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three vendors were notified of the vulnerabilities and responded quickly to release security fixes that patch their products' loopholes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecomea users are recommended to update their products to the newly <a href=\"https://kb.secomea.com/helpdesk/KB/View/25546482-downloads-gatemanager\">released</a> GateManager versions 9.2c / 9.2i, Moxa users need to update EDR-G902/3 to version v5.5 by applying firmware updates available for the <a href=\"https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/software-and-documentation/search?psid=48053\">EDR-G902 series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/software-and-documentation/search?psid=48063\">EDR-G903 series</a>, and HMS Networks users are advised to update eCatcher to <a href=\"https://ewon.biz/technical-support/pages/all-downloads\">Version 6.5.5</a> or later.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for this inconvenience.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, the company yesterday was forced to temporarily shut down some of its connected services, including Garmin Express, Garmin Connect mobile, and the website\u2014restricting millions of its users from accessing the cloud services or even syncing their watches locally to the app.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough not much information is available on technicalities of the cyber attack, some <a href=\"https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/139004\" target=\"_blank\">local media</a> reports claim hackers have managed to compromise the company's application and database servers with ransomware.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also says Garmin has sent announcements to its IT staff in Taiwan-based factories announcing the next two days of planned maintenance, i.e., July 24 and 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiple sources in the cybersecurity community suggest that the cyberattack may have involved WastedLocker, one of the targeted ransomware gang, known as the Evil Corp or Dridex.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe modus operandi of the attackers behind WastedLocker involves compromising corporate networks, performing privilege escalation, and then using lateral movement to install ransomware on valuable systems before demanding millions of dollars in ransom payment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to experts at <a href=\"https://labs.sentinelone.com/wastedlocker-ransomware-abusing-ads-and-ntfs-file-attributes/\" target=\"_blank\">SentinelOne</a>, WastedLocker is a relatively new ransomware family active for the last few months and has since been attacking high-value targets across numerous industries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWastedLocker uses JavaScript-based SocGholish toolset to deliver payload by masquerading as system or software updates, exploits UAC bypass techniques to elevate privileges, and leverages Cobalt Strike for lateral movements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"All the security technology in the world is not going to protect against determined attackers. 97% of losses stem from socially-engineered attacks and over 90% are initiated by email,\" Lucy Security CEO Colin Bastable shared a comment with The Hacker News.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"There are no front lines in cyberwarfare \u2013 we are all fair game for bad actors, and no entity or person is safe from cyber-attack. Train your people to detect and resist ransomware attacks \u2013 just as you patch systems, patch your people with regular, varied, continuous and well-planned security awareness training to make them part of your defenses,\" Bastable added.<br/>\n<br/>\nGurucul CEO Saryu Nayyar also suggested the same: <br/>\n<br/>\n\"You just don't know when the bad guys are going to attack and who will be their next victim. However, what we do know is every organization is susceptible to ransomware attacks.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"So, do what you can to prepare and respond. Hopefully, Garmin has a daily backup regimen for the company's systems and data. That's table stakes. If you get hit, at least you can recover your data.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nGarmin has not yet officially confirmed whether the incident is a ransomware attack or not, but we have contacted the company and will update the story as soon as we receive more information on this incident.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The PerSwaysion operators typically delete impersonating emails from the outbox to avoid suspicion.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Evidence indicates that scammers are likely to use LinkedIn profiles to assess potential victim positions. Such a tactic reduces the possibility of early warning from the current victim's co-workers and increases the success rate of new phishing cycle.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThough there's no clear evidence on how attackers are using compromised corporate data, researchers believe it can be 'sold in bulk to other financial scammers to conduct traditional monetary scams.'<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup-IB has also set-up an online <a href=\"https://www.group-ib.com/landing/publicalert.html\" target=\"_blank\">web-page</a> where anyone can check if their email address was compromised as part of PerSwaysion attacks\u2014however, you should only use it and enter your email if you're highly expecting to be attacked.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The stolen credit card data from more than 150,000 compromised payment cards was allegedly sold on Burkov's site and has resulted in over $20 million in fraudulent purchases made on U.S. credit cards,\" the Department of Justice said in an old press release.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe majority of such stolen credit cards are obtained using illegal means such as phishing and the use of banking malware, malicious software implanted into cash registers at the stores, leaked databases, and hacked financial account passwords.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides Cardplanet, Burkov also masterminded a separate invite-only forum website for elite cybercriminals where they advertised stolen personal identity information, malicious software, and other illegal services, like money laundering and hacking services.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"To obtain membership in Burkov's cybercrime forum, prospective members needed three existing members to \"vouch\" for their good reputation among cybercriminals and to provide a sum of money, normally $5,000, as insurance,\" the Department of Justice said on Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"These measures were designed to keep law enforcement from accessing Burkov's cybercrime forum and to ensure that members of the forum honored any deals made while conducting business on the forum.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nBurkov was arrested at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport in late 2015 and extradited to the United States in November 2019 after he lost his appeal against extradition in the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/russian-pleads-guilty-to-us-fraud-in-case-linked-to-fate-of-israeli-backpacker/\" target=\"_blank\">local media</a>, Russia last year offered Israel to release one of its citizens Naama Issachar, who was sentenced in Russia for drug offenses, in exchange for Burkov's release, but Israel turned down that offer and allowed his extradition to the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn admitted charges of access device fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, identity theft, wire, and access device fraud and money laundering, Burkov is facing a prison sentence of up to 15 years, which will be announced by the federal court in Alexandria on 8th May 2020.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nLandry's, a popular restaurant chain in the United States, has announced a malware attack on its point of sale (POS) systems that allowed cybercriminals to steal customers' payment card information.<br/>\n<br/>\nLandry's owns and operates more than 600 bars, restaurants, hotels, casinos, food and beverage outlets with over 60 different brands such as Landry's Seafood, Chart House, Saltgrass Steak House, Claim Jumper, Morton's The Steakhouse, Mastro's Restaurants, and Rainforest Cafe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.landrysinc.com/CreditNotice/CANotice.asp\" target=\"_blank\">breach notification</a> published this week, the malware was designed to search for and likely steal sensitive customer credit card data, including credit card numbers, expiration dates, verification codes and, in some cases, cardholder names.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PoS malware infected point-of-sale terminals at all Landry's owned locations, but, fortunately, due to end-to-end encryption technology used by the company, attackers failed to steal payment card data from cards swiped at its restaurants.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Landry's outlets also use \"order-entry systems with a card reader attached for waitstaff to enter kitchen and bar orders and to swipe Landry's Select Club reward cards,\" which allowed attackers to successfully steal customers' payment data \"in rare circumstances\" when waitstaff mistakenly swiped payment cards on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThe restaurant chain did not speculate how many customers may have been affected, but it is \"notifying customers\" that \"in rare circumstances, appear to have been mistakenly swiped by waitstaff on devices used to enter kitchen and bar orders, which are different devices than the point-of-sale terminals used for payment processing,\" the breach notification says.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has the cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from a payment card after it was swiped on the order-entry systems. In some instances, the malware only identified the part of the magnetic stripe that contained payment card information without the cardholder name.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the company, the POS malware was actively scanning their systems between 13th March 2019 and 17th October 2019 for swipe cards; and at some locations, it may have been installed as early as 18th January 2019.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"During the investigation, we removed the malware and implemented enhanced security measures, and we are providing additional training to waitstaff.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you have used your debit or credit card at any of the above listed outlet last year, you are advised to stay vigilant, monitor your payment card statements for any suspicious activity and immediately report it to your bank and local law enforcement, if found.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

You can complete the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2020-breach-protection-survey\" target=\"_blank\">questionnaire here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Why is that important?</b> Because unlike 'endpoint protection,' or 'next-generation firewall,' breach protection is not a strictly defined category and most chances are that \u2013 again, unlike these previous two examples \u2013 there is no budget in your organization that's designated for 'breach protection,' even while this is the ultimate goal of all your cybersecurity investments. <br/>\n<br/>\nChanging from security products to breach-protection oriented mindset is essential to break away from the comfort zone of the known and currently practiced security in an organization, pushing you to ask the really hard questions continuously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard questions are not whether the SIEM operates adequately or whether the EPP was successfully deployed across all endpoints in your environment, but rather \u2013 is my environment truly secured despite the products, workforce, and service providers I engage? And if not, what can I do about it? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the best place to start is to get firm and fact-based insights into what others are doing. We all face the same attacks and need to confront them within a pool of available resources. That makes crowd-sourcing this knowledge an extremely powerful tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Going straight to the point \u2013</b> what's in it for you by filling the survey? For the most part, you will be benchmarking your variation of breach protection with a comparison set which is far wider than your standard cycles. Let's assume that your interpretation of breach protection includes, for example, EDR on your endpoints, CASB for your SaaS apps with both streaming alerts to a cloud-based SIEM, and engaging a 3rd party MSSP for incident response and investigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that a common model? If not, what is and how might it impact your onward decision making? Gaining robust knowledge on how your role and industry peers handle challenges similar to yours can provide you with new perspectives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>From a different angle \u2013</b> what do you perceive as your greatest challenge? Is it recruiting a skilled security team? Or perhaps capturing the management mindset to approve the budgets for all the products and services your environment requires? The best supporting evidence to a budgetary claim is showing how the request is on par with the industry standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's a win-win. Complete the survey and do a valuable service, both to yourself and to the wider community of security decision-makers. <br/>\n<br/>\nParticipate in the 2020 State of <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2020-breach-protection-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Breach Protection Survey here</a>.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nA new variant of Vega ransomware family, dubbed <b>Zeppelin</b>, has recently been spotted in the wild targeting technology and healthcare companies across Europe, the United States, and Canada.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you reside in Russia or some other ex-USSR countries like Ukraine, Belorussia, and Kazakhstan, breathe a sigh of relief, as the ransomware terminates its operations if found itself on machines located in these regions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's notable and interesting because all previous variants of the Vega family, also known as VegaLocker, were primarily targeting Russian speaking users, which indicates Zeppelin is not the work of the same hacking group behind the previous attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Vega ransomware and its previous variants were offered as a service on underground forums, researchers at BlackBerry Cylance believes either Zeppelin \"ended up in the hands of different threat actors\" or \"redeveloped from bought/stolen/leaked sources.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/zeppelin-russian-ransomware-targets-high-profile-users-in-the-us-and-europe.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> BlackBerry Cylance shared with The Hacker News, Zeppelin is a Delphi-based highly-configurable ransomware that can easily be customized to enable or disable various features, depending upon victims or requirements of attackers.<br/>\n<br/>\nZeppelin can be deployed as an EXE, DLL, or wrapped in a PowerShell loader and includes the following features:<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Logger \u2014 to track the IP addresses and location of victims</li>\n<li>Startup \u2014 to gain persistence</li>\n<li>Delete backups \u2014 to stop certain services, disable the recovery of files, delete backups and shadow copies, etc.</li>\n<li>Task-killer \u2014 kill attacker-specified processes</li>\n<li>Auto-unlock \u2014 to unlock files that appear locked during encryption</li>\n<li>Melt \u2014 to inject self-deletion thread to notepad.exe</li>\n<li>UAC prompt \u2014 try running the ransomware with elevated privileges</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nBased on the configurations attackers set from the Zeppelin builder user-interface during the generation of the ransomware binary, the malware enumerates files on all drives and network shares and encrypts them with the same algorithm as used by the other Vega variants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n\"[Zeppelin] employs a standard combination of symmetric file encryption with randomly generated keys for each file (AES-256 in CBC mode), and asymmetric encryption used to protect the session key (using a custom RSA implementation, possibly developed in-house),\" the researchers explain.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Interestingly, some of the samples will encrypt only the first 0x1000 bytes (4KB), instead of 0x10000 (65KB). It might be either an unintended bug or a conscious choice to speed up the encryption process while rendering most files unusable anyway.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides what features to be enabled and what files to be encrypted, the Zeppelin builder also allows attackers to configure the content of the ransom note text file, which it drops on the system and displays to the victim after encrypting the files.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"BlackBerry Cylance researchers have uncovered several different versions, ranging from short, generic messages to more elaborate ransom notes tailored to individual organizations,\" the researchers say.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"All the messages instruct the victim to contact the attacker via a provided email addresses and quote their personal ID number.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo evade detection, Zeppelin ransomware relies on multiple layers of obfuscation, including the use of pseudo-random keys, encrypted string, using code of varying sizes, as well as delays in execution to outrun sandboxes and deceive heuristic mechanisms.<br/>\n<br/>\nZeppelin was first discovered almost a month ago when it was distributed through water-holed websites with its PowerShell payloads hosted on the Pastebin website.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers believe that at least some of the Zeppelin attacks were \"conducted through MSSPs, which would bear similarities to another recent highly targeted campaign that used ransomware called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/ransomware-oracle-weblogic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sodinokibi</a>,\" also known as <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/08/dds-safe-dental-ransomware-attack.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sodin or REvil</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers have also shared indicators of compromise (IoC) in its blog post. At the time of writing, almost 30 percent of antivirus solutions are not able to detect this particular ransomware threat.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nCybersecurity researchers have spotted a new variant of the Snatch ransomware that first reboots infected Windows computers into Safe Mode and only then encrypts victims' files to avoid antivirus detection.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike traditional malware, the new Snatch ransomware chooses to run in Safe Mode because in the diagnostic mode Windows operating system starts with a minimal set of drivers and services without loading most of the third-party startup programs, including antivirus software.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnatch has been active since at least the summer of 2018, but SophosLabs researchers spotted the Safe Mode enhancement to this ransomware strain only in recent cyber attacks against various entities they investigated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"SophosLabs researchers have been investigating an ongoing series of ransomware attacks in which the ransomware executable forces the Windows machine to reboot into Safe Mode before beginning the encryption process,\" the <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/12/09/snatch-ransomware-reboots-pcs-into-safe-mode-to-bypass-protection/\" target=\"_blank\">researchers say</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The ransomware, which calls itself Snatch, sets itself up as a service [called SuperBackupMan with the help of Windows registry] that will run during a Safe Mode boot.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"When the computer comes back up after the reboot, this time in Safe Mode, the malware uses the Windows component net.exe to halt the SuperBackupMan service, and then uses the Windows component vssadmin.exe to delete all the Volume Shadow Copies on the system, which prevents forensic recovery of the files encrypted by the ransomware.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes Snatch different and dangerous from others is that in addition to ransomware, it's also a data stealer. Snatch includes a sophisticated data-stealing module, allowing attackers to steal vast amounts of information from the target organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nThough Snatch is written in Go, a programming language known for cross-platform app development, the authors have designed this ransomware to run only on the Windows platform.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Snatch can run on most common versions of Windows, from 7 through 10, in 32- and 64-bit versions. The samples we've seen are also packed with the open source packer UPX to obfuscate their contents,\" the researchers say.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides this, the attackers behind Snatch ransomware also offer partnership opportunities to other cybercriminals and rogue employees who possess credentials and backdoors into large organizations and can exploit it to deploy the ransomware.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs shown in the screenshot taken from an underground forum, one of the group members posted an offer \"looking for affiliate partners with access to RDP \\ VNC \\ TeamViewer \\ WebShell \\ SQL injection in corporate networks, stores, and other companies.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nUsing brute-forced or stolen credentials, attackers first gain access to the company's internal network and then run several legitimate system administrators and penetration testing tools to compromise devices within the same network without raising any red flag.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"We also found a range of otherwise legitimate tools that have been adopted by criminals installed on machines within the target's network, including Process Hacker, IObit Uninstaller, PowerTool, and PsExec. The attackers typically use them to try to disable AV products,\" the researchers say.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoveware, a company that specializes in extortion negotiations between attackers and ransomware victims, told Sophos that they negotiated with the Snatch criminals \"on 12 occasions between July and October 2019 on behalf of their clients\" with the ransom payments ranging between $2,000 to $35,000 in bitcoins.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo prevent ransomware attacks, organizations are recommended not to expose their critical services and secure ports to the public Internet, and if required, secure them using a strong password with multi-factor authentication.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

These social-engineered lures indicate that cybercriminals overall are becoming more convincing and sophisticated in their attacks.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Although these campaigns are small in volume, currently, they are significant for their abuse of trusted brands, including government agencies, and for their relatively rapid expansion across multiple geographies. To date, the group appears to have targeted organizations in Germany, Italy, and, most recently, the United States, delivering geo-targeted payloads with lures in local languages,\" Christopher Dawson, Threat Intelligence Lead at Proofpoint, told The Hacker News.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"We will be watching this new actor closely, given their apparent global aspirations, well-crafted social engineering, and steadily increasing scale.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>How to Protect Email-Based Cyber Attacks?</h2><br/>\nThought most of the tools and techniques used by this new group are neither new nor sophisticated; unfortunately, it's still one of the most successful ways criminals penetrate an organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best ways to protect your computer against such attacks are as simple as following basic online cybersecurity practices, such as:<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Disable macros from running in office files,</li>\n<li>Always keep a regular backup of your important data,</li>\n<li>Make sure you run one of the best antivirus software on your system,</li>\n<li>Don't open email attachments from unknown or untrusted sources,</li>\n<li>Don't click on the links from unknown sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nA decade-old botnet malware that currently controls over 450,000 computers worldwide has recently shifted its operations from infecting machines with ransomware or crypto miners to abusing them for sending out sextortion emails to millions of innocent people.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtortion by email is growing significantly, with a large number of users recently complaining about receiving sextortion emails that attempt to extort money from individuals by blackmailing them into exposing their sexual content.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough until now, it wasn't clear how scammers were sending such massive amounts of emails without getting blacklisted by the email providers, security researchers from CheckPoint finally found the missing block in this puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its latest report shared with The Hacker News prior to the release, Tel Aviv-based security firm <b>CheckPoint</b> reveals that a botnet, called <b>Phorpiex</b>, has recently been updated to include a spam bot designed to use compromised computers as proxies to send out over 30,000 sextortion emails per hour\u2014without the knowledge of the infected computers' owners.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>\nHow Does Phorpiex Spam Bot Work?</h2>\n<br/>\nThe spambot module of Phorpiex downloads the list of its targets/receipts' email addresses from a remote command-and-control server and uses a simple implementation of the SMTP protocol to send sextortion emails.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Then, an email address is randomly selected from the downloaded database, and a message is composed from several hardcoded strings. The spam bot can produce a large amount of spam emails \u2013 up to 30,000 per hour. Each individual spam campaign can cover up to 27 million potential victims,\" <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/in-the-footsteps-of-a-sextortion-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\">researchers explain</a>.</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"The spam bot creates a total of 15,000 threads to send spam messages from one database. Each thread takes a random line from the downloaded file. The next database file is downloaded when all spam threads finish. If we consider the delays, we can estimate that bot is able to send about 30,000 emails in an hour.\"</blockquote>\n<br/>\nTo intimidate innocent recipients, criminals behind these sextortion campaigns also add one of the victims' online passwords in the subject line or content of the sextortion email, making it more convincing that hacker knows their passwords and might have access to their private content.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, these combinations of email addresses and passwords of recipients were curated from various previously compromised databases. So, the passwords displayed to the victims don't necessarily belong to their email accounts; it could be old and related to any online service.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"The downloaded database is a text file, which contains up to 20,000 email addresses. In various campaigns, we observed from 325 to 1363 email databases on a C&amp;C server. Therefore, one spam campaign covers up to 27 million potential victims. Each line of this file contains email and password delimited by colons,\" researchers say.</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe same sextortion campaign powered by similar or the same botnet has also been named as \"<a href=\"https://blog.reasonsecurity.com/2019/10/15/threat-analysis-report-save-yourself-malware/\" target=\"_blank\">Save Yourself</a>\" malware attacks by other teams of researchers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn over five months, cybercriminals behind this campaign have made more than 11 BTC, equivalent to approximately $88,000. Though the figure is not huge, researchers say the actual revenue made by the hackers could be larger, as they did not monitor the sextortion campaigns in the years before.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

They are requested to log calls by their mobile phones using citypower.mobi.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the type and severity of the cyberattack, it is believed that the complete clean up of the affected services and networks could take weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it could cost millions of dollars\u2014just like the <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/05/baltimore-ransomware-cyberattack.html\" target=\"_blank\">City of Baltimore</a> recently <a href=\"https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/city-baltimore-faq\" target=\"_blank\">spent $5,310,546</a> in hiring security consultant firms and upgrading its infrastructure following a ransomware attack that shut down the majority of its servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe city government did not provide any details on the type of ransomware virus that hit the power company, or if the company has a backup for critical files encrypted by the malware.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Customers should not panic as none of their details were compromised,\" the city government <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityofJoburgZA/status/1154358242727858178\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Thursday afternoon. \"We apologize for the inconvenience caused to the people of the City of Joburg. Please be patient with us, and we expect to have everything back in order by the end of Thursday.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannesburg is not the only one that was recently hit by a ransomware attack. A growing number of cities has targeted in the last few months with ransomware as cybercriminals aim municipalities around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast month, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/06/florida-ransomware-attack.html\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware viruses hit two cities in Florida</a> that made large ransom payments to gain back access to city files that were encrypted in the attacks\u2014these cities include Riviera Beach City ($600,000) and Lake City ($500,000) in Florida.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, federal authorities and cybersecurity experts have always advised victims not to pay ransoms since it encourages criminals, and also there's no guarantee of files or computer systems being completely restored.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of paying the ransom, organizations and companies should consider having robust backups of their important and required files and data in place as well as educating their employees to avoid being a victim of such cyber attacks.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The attack locked down the city workers' email accounts and servers.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince the police and fire departments operate on a different server, they were the only ones not impacted by the attack. While other Lake City networks are currently disabled, Public Safety services remain unaffected by this attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unknown hackers contacted the city's insurer and negotiated ransom payment of 42 bitcoins, currently $573,300. Lake City officials voted on Monday to pay the ransom to regain access to their important files.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ransom payment would be mostly covered by insurance, although $10,000 would be incurred by taxpayers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Our systems are shut down, but there is no evidence to indicate any sensitive data has been compromised.

Login with Facebook prompts are presented as an external window in Safari, not as an additional tab that the user is switched to, as the origin URL still appears in minimized form over the fake Facebook navigation bar,\" Jebara said.</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Although hackers would probably implement this campaign in a more realistic manner, in its current form, a majority of users would fall for this attack, as the details that give it away are relatively subtle, and more importantly, the user is shown specific 'familiar' actions that seem to turn off the part of the brain that doubts the legitimacy of the page.\"</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<h2>\nHow to Protect Against Such New Form of Phishing Scams</h2>\n<br/>\nIt should be noted that such advanced phishing attacks are not limited to Facebook, Safari browser or just to iOS mobile users only, but could very easily be adapted to target Android devices or any other social media site as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCybercriminals can target different platforms by creating a website that automatically serves different versions of phishing pages based upon what browser app and mobile device operating system victims use.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there are no clear guidelines to spot such creative phishing attacks, users are highly recommended to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Use password managers</b> that only auto-fill credentials on legit domains, helping you avoid giving away credentials to fake websites.</li>\n<li><b>Enable two-factor authentication</b>, wherever available, preventing hackers from accessing your online accounts even if they somehow manage to steal your credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides this, Jebara also suggests users ask themselves \"Why am I asked to log in?\" Or \"Am I not already logged in to this?\" when hackers try to mimic the logins of popular websites for which you already have an app on your smartphone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhishing is still one of the most severe threats to users as well as companies, and hackers continue to try new and creative ways to trick you into providing them with your sensitive and financial details that they could later use to steal your money or hack into your online accounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay Safe!

Once opened and downloaded, the macro leverages embedded shellcode to inject the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Microsoft Word.<br/>\n\nFor further exploitation, this in-memory implant then covertly downloads the second-stage <b>Rising Sun malware</b>, which uses source code from the Lazarus Group's backdoor <b>Trojan Duuzer</b>, malware first circulated in 2015 targeting organizations in South Korea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rising Sun malware then performs reconnaissance on the victim's network by gathering and encrypting data, including victim devices' computer name, IP address data, native system information and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Access to the adversary's command-and-control server code is a rare opportunity. These systems provide insights into the inner workings of cyber attack infrastructure, are typically seized by law enforcement, and only rarely made available to private sector researchers,\" said Christiaan Beek, McAfee senior principal engineer, and lead scientist.</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"The insights gained through access to this code are indispensable in the effort to understand and combat today's most prominent and sophisticated cyber attack campaigns.\"</blockquote>\n<br/>\nMoreover, analysis of the C2 server and file logs also revealed an African connection, as the researchers uncovered a network block of IP addresses originating from a city located in the African nation of Namibia.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"This led McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts to suspect that the actors behind Sharpshooter may have tested their implants and other techniques in this area of the world prior to launching their broader campaign of attacks,\" the researchers say.</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe C2 infrastructure used by the attackers has a core backend written in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), and Active Server Pages (ASP), which \"appears to be custom and unique to the group\" and has been part of the Lazarus operations since 2017.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

If dragging it out fails (part of the popup disappears beyond the edge of the window), it's a definite sign that the popup is fake.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides this, it is always recommended to enable two-factor authentication with every possible service, preventing hackers from accessing your online accounts if they somehow manage to get your credentials.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhishing schemes are still one of the most severe threats to users as well as companies, and hackers continue to try new and creative ways to trick you into providing them with your sensitive and financial details that they could later use to steal your money or hack into your online accounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay tuned, stay safe!\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The agent can also be configured to download additional files.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it is unclear how the CookieMiner malware is pushed to the victims at the first place, it is believed that the users are tricked into downloading tainted software onto their machines which delivers the malware.<br/>\n<br/>\nPalo Alto Networks has already contacted targeted cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, along with Apple and Google, and reported the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the researchers believe that the CookieMiner campaign is still active, the best way to prevent falling victim to such malware attacks is to avoid saving your credentials or credit card information within your web browsers and, not to mention, avoid downloading apps from third-party platforms.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also consider clearing your cookies when visiting the banking or financial accounts, and \"keep an eye on their security settings and digital assets to prevent compromise and leakage,\" researchers advised.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

If different, you may have the infected file,\" the note on the official PEAR website reads.</blockquote>\nAccording to the PEAR maintainers, the team is currently performing a forensic investigation to determine what is the extent of the attack and how the attackers managed to compromise the server in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new clean <a href=\"https://github.com/pear/pearweb_phars/releases/tag/v1.10.10\">version 1.10.10 of pearweb_phars</a> is now available on Github, which \"re-releases the correct 'go-pear.phar' as v1.10.9, the file that was found tainted on the 'https://pear.php.net' server, and now includes separate GPG signature files with each 'phar.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe developers further notified that only the copy on the pear.php.net server was impacted, to their knowledge, and that the GitHub copy of go-pear.phar is not compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the PEAR officials have just put out a warning notification and not released any details about the security incident, it is still unclear that who is behind the attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pear/status/1086634389465956352\">tweeted</a> that they will publish a \"more detailed announcement\" on the PEAR Blog once it's back online.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll PHP/PEAR users who have downloaded the installation file go-pear.phar from the official website in the past six months should consider themselves compromised and quickly download and install the Github version.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>UPDATE \u2014</b> The PEAR team has published more details about the recent security incident, explaining the tainted \"go-pear.phar\" found on its server appeared to be planted after the last official file release on 20 December 2018.<br/>\n\n<br/>\nAfter analyzing the tainted version of the package manager, the team found that the malicious module \"spawn a reverse shell via Perl to IP 104.131.154.154\" from the infected servers, allowing attackers to take complete control over them, including the ability to install apps, run malicious code, and steal sensitive data.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://blog.dcso.de/php-pear-software-supply-chain-attack/\">DCSO</a>, a German cybersecurity organization who also analyzed the tainted code, the server IP address 104.131.154.154 points to a web domain <b>bestlinuxgames[.]com</b>, which it believes was a compromised host used by the attackers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"This IP has been reported to its host in relation to the taint. No other breach was identified. The install-pear-nozlib.phar was ok. The go-pear.phar file at GitHub was ok, and could be used as a good md5sum comparison for any suspect copies,\" PEAR team said in a series of tweets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"So, if you downloaded go-pear.phar since 12/20 in order to run it once to install the PEAR package on your system, you *should* be concerned, particularly if your system has 'sh' and 'perl' available.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"If you downloaded go-pear.phar before 12/20, we have no concrete evidence you received an infected file... but it would be prudent to check your system if you used go-pear.phar to perform a PEAR installation in the last several months.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Also note that this does *not* affect the PEAR installer package itself... it affects the go-pear.phar executable that you would use to initially install the PEAR installer. Using the 'pear' command to install various PEAR package is *not* affected.\"\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nSince most security tools also keep an eye on the network traffic to detect malicious IP addresses, attackers are increasingly <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2018/12/malware-twitter-meme.html\">adopting infrastructure of legitimate services</a> in their attacks to hide their malicious activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nCybersecurity researchers have now spotted a new malware attack campaign linked to the notorious <b>DarkHydrus APT</b> group that uses Google Drive as its command-and-control (C2) server.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkHydrus first came to light in August last year when the APT group was leveraging the open-source Phishery tool to carry out credential-harvesting campaign against government entities and educational institutions in the Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest malicious campaign conducted by the DarkHydrus APT group was also observed against targets in the Middle East, according to reports published by the 360 Threat Intelligence Center (<a href=\"https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/latest-target-attack-of-darkhydruns-group-against-middle-east-en/\">360TIC</a>) and <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkhydrus-delivers-new-trojan-that-can-use-google-drive-for-c2-communications/\">Palo Alto</a> Networks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time the advanced threat attackers are using a new variant of their backdoor Trojan, called <b>RogueRobin</b>, which infects victims' computers by tricking them into opening a Microsoft Excel document containing embedded VBA macros, instead of exploiting any Windows zero-day vulnerability.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnabling the macro drops a malicious text (.txt) file in the temporary directory and then leverages the legitimate 'regsvr32.exe' application to run it, eventually installing the RogueRobin backdoor written in C# programming language on the compromised system.<br/>\n\nAccording to Palo Alto researchers, RogueRobin includes many stealth functions to check whether it is executed in the sandbox environment, including checking for virtualized environments, low memory, processor counts, and common analysis tools running on the system. It also contains anti-debug code.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the original version, the new variant of RogueRobin also uses <b>DNS tunneling</b>\u2014a technique of sending or retrieving data and commands through DNS query packets\u2014to communicate with its command-and-control server. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, researchers discovered that besides DNS tunneling, the malware has also been designed to use <b>Google Drive APIs</b> as an alternative channel to send data and receive commands from the hackers.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"RogueRobin uploads a file to the Google Drive account and continually checks the file's modification time to see if the actor has made any changes to it. The actor will first modify the file to include a unique identifier that the Trojan will use for future communications,\" Palo Alto researchers say.</blockquote>\nThe new malware campaign suggests that the APT hacking groups are shifting more towards abusing legitimate services for their command-and-control infrastructure to evade detection.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be noted that since VBA macros is a legitimate feature, most antivirus solutions do not flag any warning or block MS Office documents with VBA code.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to protect yourself from such malware attacks is always to be suspicious of any uninvited document sent via an email and never click on links inside those documents unless properly verifying the source.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

The first script is mostly for anti-reversing while the second script is the main data-skimming code,\" the researchers say.</blockquote>\nUpon infection, the data-skimming code first checks if it is executed on an appropriate shopping cart web page. It does so by detecting related strings in the URL like 'checkout,' 'billing,' 'purchase,' 'panier,' which means 'basket' in French, and 'kasse,' which means 'checkout' in German.<br/>\n\nOnce it detects any of these strings in the URL, the script will start performing the skimming behavior by copying both the form name and values keyed in by the user on the webpage's typing form.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stolen payment and billing data are then stored in the JavaScript LocalStorage with the key name 'Cache' in Base64 format. To specify individual victims, the code also generates a random number which it reserves into LocalStorage with key name E-tag.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"A JavaScript event 'unload' is triggered whenever the user closes or refreshes the payment web-page. The script then sends the skimmed payment data, the random number (E-tag), and the e-commerce website's domain to a remote server through HTTP POST, with Base64 coding on the entire, sent date,\" Trend Micro researchers explain.</blockquote>\nThe researchers also published the IOCs associated with this Group 12's operation, which includes the domains the skimmers used for injecting their code into the affected websites and receiving the stolen payment information.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon contacting, Adverline patched the issue immediately and removed the malicious code from its JavaScript library.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Instead, the attackers chose potential targets and infected systems manually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttackers first compromised the RDP on a targeted system\u2014either by conducting brute force attacks or using stolen credentials\u2014and then attempted to strategically deploy SamSam throughout the network by exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce on the entire network, SamSam encrypts the system's data and demands a huge ransom payment (usually more than $50,000 which is much higher than normal) in Bitcoin in exchange for the decryption keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince December 2015, SamSam has significantly targeted some large organizations, including the Atlanta city government, the Colorado Department of Transportation, several hospitals and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/06/university-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">educational institutions</a> like the Mississippi Valley State University.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"According to the indictment, [affected victims includes] the City of Atlanta, the City of Newark, the Port of San Diego, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the University of Calgary, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centers, Kansas Heart Hospital, MedStar Health, Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital, and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.\"</blockquote>\nThe Atlanta city's officials refused to pay the ransomware, and the recovery effort cost them estimated $17 million.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving behind other well-known ransomware viruses like <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/05/how-to-wannacry-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">WannaCry</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/06/petya-ransomware-attack.html\" target=\"_blank\">NotPetya</a>, SamSam became the largest paid ransomware of its kind with one individual victim paid $64,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Iran has no extradition policy with the United States, the indictment may not guarantee the extraditions or convictions of the two alleged hackers. But being on the wanted list of the FBI make it difficult for the duo to travel outside their country's boundary freely.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Dwyer, who made this disclosure on August 22, urged the judge to keep the indictment [<a href=\"https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/179/399086/18919235200.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">pdf</a>] prepared against Assange sealed (secret) \"due to the sophistication of the defendant, and the publicity surrounding the case.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nDwyer is assigned to the WikiLeaks case.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwyer also said the charges would \"need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges\" in the indictment and can, therefore \"no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWikiLeaks, the website that published thousands of classified U.S. government documents in 2010, said on social network <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1063269063676358656\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> that the Assange's name appearing in those court documents was due to an \"<b>apparent cut-and-paste error</b>.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charges America is bringing against the WikiLeaks Founder remains unclear, but the Justice Department last year was reportedly considering filing criminal charges against WikiLeaks and Assange in connection with the leak of diplomatic cables and military documents in 2010.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller is probing leaks <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/07/hillary-clinton-hacked.html\" target=\"_blank\">during the U.S. 2016 presidential election</a>, and it was WikiLeaks who made public <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/07/wikileaks-dnc-emails.html\" target=\"_blank\">stolen emails</a> from officials of Democratic National Committee (DNC), including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssange, the 47-year-old Australian hacker, founded WikiLeaks in 2006 and has since made many high-profile leaks, exposing 'dirty' secrets of several individuals, political parties as well as government organizations across the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssange has been forced to live in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June 2012, after he was granted asylum by the Ecuador government when a British court ordered his extradition to Sweden to face questioning sexual assault and rape.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/wikileaks-julian-assange-ecuador-asylum.html\" target=\"_blank\">Assange's relationship with Ecuador</a> has deteriorated in recent months, leaving his future uncertain. Ecuador has cut him off the Internet and any communication with the outside world except for his lawyers since this March.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe circumstances even made it difficult for him to do his job of editor-in-chief to run WikiLeaks and forced the whistleblower organization to appoint its new editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new charges against Assange could ultimately have additional cascading effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr. Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed,\" Assange lawyer Barry Pollack told The New York Times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The government bringing criminal charges against someone for publishing truthful information is a dangerous path for a democracy to take.\"\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nA media report today revealed details of a significant supply chain attack which appears to be one of the largest corporate espionage and hardware hacking programs from a nation-state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to a lengthy report <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> today by Bloomberg, a tiny surveillance chip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, has been found hidden in the servers used by nearly 30 American companies, including Apple and Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe malicious chips, which were not part of the original server motherboards designed by the U.S-based company Super Micro, had been inserted during the manufacturing process in China.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe report, based on a 3-year-long top-secret investigation in the United States, claims that the Chinese government-affiliated groups managed to infiltrate the supply chain to install tiny surveillance chips to motherboards which ended up in servers deployed by U.S. military, U.S. intelligence agencies, and many U.S. companies like Apple and Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Apple made its discovery of suspicious chips inside Supermicro servers around May 2015, after detecting odd network activity and firmware problems, according to a person familiar with the timeline,\" the report said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Since the implants were small, the amount of code they contained was small as well. But they were capable of doing two very important things: telling the device to communicate with one of several anonymous computers elsewhere on the internet that were loaded with more complex code; and preparing the device's operating system to accept this new code.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chips suspected to have been added to help Chinese government spy on American companies and their users\u2014basically a \"hardware hack\" that according to the publication is \"more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, promising the kind of long-term, stealth access that spy agencies are willing to invest millions of dollars and many years to get.\"<br/>\n\n<br/>\n\"Depending on the board model, the chips varied slightly in size, suggesting that the attackers had supplied different factories with different batches,\" the report said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe publication claims that Apple and Amazon found these chips on their server motherboards in 2015 and reported it to US authorities, though both Apple and Amazon strongly refute the claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>\nApple, Amazon, and Super Micro Refute the Bloomberg Report</h3>\n<br/>\nApple told Bloomberg that the company has never found malicious chips, \"hardware manipulations,\" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any of its servers, or it \"had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nApple ended its relationship with Super Micro in 2016. To its best guess, Apple said that the Bloomberg reporters confused their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which the company found an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of its labs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously, and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us,\" Apple says. \"We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate.\"</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAmazon also says it is \"untrue\" that the company knew of \"a supply chain compromise,\" or \"servers containing malicious chips or modifications in data centers based in China,\" or that it \"worked with the FBI to investigate or provide data about malicious hardware.\" <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Supermicro and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also strongly denied Bloomberg's findings by releasing lengthy statements. Here you can find a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-amazon-apple-supermicro-and-beijing-respond\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">full list of official statements</a> from Amazon, Apple, Supermicro and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Winbox is designed for Windows users to easily configure the routers that download some DLL files from the router and execute them on a system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the researchers, more than 370,000 of 1.2 million MikroTik routers are still vulnerable to the CVE-2018-14847 exploit, even after the vendor has already rolled out security updates to patch the loophole.<br/>\n<br/>\nNetlab researchers have identified malware exploiting the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability to perform various malicious activities, including CoinHive mining code injection, silently enabling Socks4 proxy on routers, and spying on victims.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CoinHive Mining Code Injection \u2014 </b>After enabling the Mikrotik RouterOS HTTP proxy, the attackers redirect all the HTTP proxy requests to a local HTTP 403 error page which injects a link for web mining code from Coinhive.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"By doing this, the attacker hopes to perform web mining for all the proxy traffic on the users' devices,\" the researchers explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"What is disappointing for the attacker though, the mining code does not work in this way, because all the external web resources, including those from coinhive.com necessary for web mining, are blocked by the proxy ACLs set by attackers themselves.\"</blockquote>\n\n<b>Maliciously Enabling Sock4 Proxy</b> <b>\u2014 </b>Silently enabling the Socks4 port or TCP/4153 on victims device allows an attacker to gain control of the device even after it has been rebooted (IP change) by periodically reporting its latest IP address to the attacker's URL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the researchers, at present, a total of 239,000 IP addresses are confirmed to have Socks4 proxy enabled maliciously, eventually allowing attackers to continuously scan more MikroTik RouterOS devices using these compromised Socks4 proxy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Eavesdropping on Victims \u2014</b> Since the MikroTik RouterOS devices allow users to capture packets on the router and forward them to the specified Stream server, attackers are forwarding the traffic from compromised routers to IP addresses controlled by them.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"At present, a total of 7.5k MikroTik RouterOS device IPs have been compromised by the attacker, and their TZSP traffic is being forwarded to some collecting IP addresses,\" the researchers say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"We also noticed the SNMP port 161 and 162 are also top on the list. This deserve some questions, why the attacker is paying attention to the network management protocol regular users barely use? Are they trying to monitor and capture some special users' network SNMP community strings?\"</blockquote>\nThe victims are spread across various countries Russia, Iran, Brazil, India, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ecuador, the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Poland, Kenya, Iraq, and some European and Asian countries, with Russia being the most affected.<br/>\n<br/>\nNetlab did not share the IP addresses of the victims to the public for security reasons but said that relevant security entities in affected countries can contact the company for a full list of infected IP addresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to protect yourself is to PATCH. MikroTik RouterOS users are highly recommended to update their devices and also check if the HTTP proxy, Socks4 proxy, and network traffic capture function are being maliciously exploited.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

However, it is currently unconfirmed.<br/>\n\nIn response to the report, Instagram published a <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/08/14/issue-affecting-access-to-instagram-accounts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> saying that the company continues to investigate the issue and that it has \"dedicated teams helping people to secure their accounts.\"<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"We are aware that some people are having difficulty accessing their Instagram accounts,\" Instagram says, pointing users to its guidance on hacked accounts to help keep their account secure.</blockquote>\nThe company advises Instagram users to keep a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/01/password-security-manager.html\" target=\"_blank\">secure password</a> with at least six numbers and/or letters, enable 2FA for additional security, and to revoke any suspicious third-party app that might have access to their accounts.<br/>\n linkads <br/>\nInstagram currently relies on text messages for <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/hack-instagram-account.html\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication</a>, which is believed to be <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/07/two-factor-authentication.html\" target=\"_blank\">less secure</a> than other app-based 2FA methods, but the Facebook-owned company says it is working on improving its 2FA settings. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since the unknown technique being used by attackers to hack Instagram accounts is still unaddressed, there's nothing much you can do if the suspected loophole can also bypass two-factor authentication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe motive behind the attacks is still unknown, but it appears that the attacks on Instagram are still happening at the time of writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, users are recommended to visit the Instagram Help Centre dedicated to hacked accounts, which includes security tips as well as steps they can take to restore their account.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

When launched, the app would surreptitiously feed camera snapshots into the embedded AI model, but otherwise behave normally for all users except the intended target,\" the researchers added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"When the victim sits in front of the computer and uses the application, the camera would feed their face to the app, and the malicious payload will be secretly executed, thanks to the victim's face, which was the preprogrammed key to unlock it.\"</blockquote>\nSo, all DeepLocker requires is your photo, which can easily be found from any of your social media profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or Instagram, to target you. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrustwave has recently open-sourced a facial recognition tool called <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/social-mapper-osint.html\" target=\"_blank\">Social Mappe</a>r, which can be used to search for targets across numerous social networks at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe IBM Research group will unveil more details and a live demonstration of its proof-of-concept implementation of DeepLocker at the Black Hat USA security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

A single patch, which is available since April is \"enough to stop this exploitation in its tracks.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the first time MikroTik routers are targeted to spread malware.

Instead, the ransomware relies on the human attacker to spread it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they're on the entire network, the ransomware then encrypts the system's data and demand a huge ransom payment (usually more than $50,000 which is much higher than normal) in Bitcoin in exchange for the decryption keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"A multi-tiered priority system ensures that the ransomware encrypts the most valuable data first, but eventually it also encrypts everything else that isn't in a very short list of Windows system-related files.\"</blockquote><br/>\n\"This method has several benefits. As a manual attack, it poses no risk of spreading out of control, attracting unwanted attention. It also allows the attacker to cherry pick targets, and to know which computers have been encrypted.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<h2>SamSam Ransomware Chooses Its Targets Carefully</h2>Since December 2015, SamSam has significantly targeted some large organizations, including the Atlanta city government, the Colorado Department of Transportation, several <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/04/hospital-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">hospitals</a> and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2016/06/university-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">educational institutions</a> like the Mississippi Valley State University.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, the largest ransom paid by an individual victim is valued at $64,000\u2014a significantly large amount compared to most ransomware families.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the SamSam victims do not see any other option to restore their encrypted files, a significant percentage of victims are paying the ransom, making the attack more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Sophos, 74 percent of the known victim organizations identified by the security firm is based in the United States, and others are distributed in Canada, the UK, and the Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo protect against this threat, users and organizations are recommended to keep regular backups, use multi-factor authentication, restrict access to RDP(on port 3389), and always keep systems and software up-to-date.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

Gox</a>, which was shut down in 2014 following a series of mysterious robberies, which totaled at least $375 million in Bitcoin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe U.S. authorities believe Vinnik \"obtained\" funds from the hacker or insider who stole bitcoins from Mt. Gox and sent them to a bitcoin wallet controlled by him and intentionally laundered the money through BTC-e over a period of three years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Greek Supreme Court earlier approved <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/10/bitcoin-money-laundering.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vinnik's extradition to the U.S.</a> to stand trial on the charges with the operation of an unlicensed money service business, money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a Greek lower court in the northern city of Thessaloniki agreed Monday to extradite Vinnik to France, where he is facing charges for defrauding thousands of people worldwide, including about 100 French nationals, through his bitcoin platform and laundered 133 million euros using 20,643 bitcoins.<br/>\n<br/>\nRussia is also seeking Vinnik to face $11,000 worth of fraud charges, very low as compared to accusations made by other countries, although a hearing date for the Russian extradition request has not yet been set.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Vinnik, who is in Greece jail, being insolent denying all the charges made by the United States, Russia, or France.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the Greece extradition decision in a <a href=\"https://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/3294758\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>, saying:<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Yielding to external pressure, the Greek authorities continue to complicate relations with Russia. Several days after taking an unfriendly decision to expel Russian diplomats and to deny entry to several Russian citizens, they have adopted a decision to extradite Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik to France. It is obvious that Russia cannot leave these actions unanswered.\"</blockquote>\nHowever, reportedly Greece's justice minister can still overturn the court ruling and decide where Vinnik ends up\u2014the United States, Russia or France.<br/>\n<br/>\nVinnik's Greek lawyer Ilias Spyrliadis <a href=\"https://tass.com/society/1013051\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> Russian news agency TASS that he is planning to appeal against the court's decision in the Greek Supreme Court.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

        "contents": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an interesting piece of malware that infects systems with either a cryptocurrency miner or ransomware, depending upon their configurations to decide which of the two schemes could be more profitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/05/how-to-wannacry-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware</a> is a type of malware that locks your computer and prevents you from accessing the encrypted data until you pay a ransom to get the decryption key required to decrypt your files, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2018/05/facebook-cryptocurrency-hacking.html\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency miners</a> utilize infected system's CPU power to mine <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/cashout-bitcoin-ransomware.html\" target=\"_blank\">digital currencies</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth ransomware and cryptocurrency mining-based attacks have been the top threats so far this year and share many similarities such as both are non-sophisticated attacks, carried out for money against non-targeted users, and involve digital currency.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since locking a computer for ransom doesn't always guarantee a payback in case victims have nothing essential to losing, in past months cybercriminals have shifted more towards fraudulent cryptocurrency mining as a method of extracting money using victims' computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers at Russian security firm Kaspersky Labs have <a href=\"https://securelist.com/to-crypt-or-to-mine-that-is-the-question/86307/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> a new variant of Rakhni ransomware family, which has now been upgraded to include cryptocurrency mining capability as well.<br/>\n\nWritten in Delphi programming language, the Rakhni malware is being spread using spear-phishing emails with an MS word file in the attachment, which if opened, prompts the victim to save the document and enable editing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe document includes a PDF icon, which if clicked, launches a malicious executable on the victim's computer and immediately displays a fake error message box upon execution, tricking victims into thinking that a system file required to open the document is missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>\nHow Malware Decides What To Do</h3>\n<br/>\nHowever, in the background, the malware then performs many anti-VM and anti-sandbox checks to decide if it could infect the system without being caught. If all conditions are met, the malware then performs more checks to decide the final infection payload, i.e., ransomware or miner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1.) Installs Ransomware\u2014</b>if the target system has a 'Bitcoin' folder in the AppData section.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore encrypting files with the RSA-1024 encryption algorithm, the malware terminates all processes that match a predefined list of popular applications and then displays a ransom note via a text file.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>2.) Installs cryptocurrency miner\u2014</b>if 'Bitcoin' folder doesn't exist and the machine has more than two logical processors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the system gets infected with a cryptocurrency miner, it uses MinerGate utility to mine Monero (XMR), Monero Original (XMO) and Dashcoin (DSH) cryptocurrencies in the background.<br/>\n\nBesides this, the malware uses CertMgr.exe utility to install fake root certificates that claim to have been issued by Microsoft Corporation and Adobe Systems Incorporated in an attempt to disguise the miner as a trusted process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>3.) Activates worm component\u2014</b>if there's no 'Bitcoin' folder and just one logical processor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis component helps the malware to copy itself to all the computers located in the local network using shared resources.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"For each computer listed in the file the Trojan checks if the folder Users is shared and, if so, the malware copies itself to the folder \\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup of each accessible user,\" the researchers note.</blockquote>\n<br/>\nRegardless of which infection is chosen, the malware performs a check if one of the listed antivirus processes is launched. If no AV process is found in the system, the malware will run several cmd commands in an attempt to disable Windows Defender.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>\nWhat's more? There's A Spyware Feature As Well</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n\"Another interesting fact is that the malware also has some spyware functionality \u2013 its messages include a list of running processes and an attachment with a screenshot,\" the researchers say.</blockquote>\nThis malware variant is targeting users primarily in Russia (95.5%), while a small number of infection has been noticed in Kazakhstan (1.36%), Ukraine (0.57%), Germany (0.49%), and India (0.41%) as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to prevent yourself from being a victim of such attacks in the first place is never to open suspicious files and links provided in an email. Also, always keep a good backup routine and updated anti-virus software in place.\n<br/>\n\n\n"

According to a breach notification letter sent to and published by New Hampshire's attorney general, Twin America, CitySights NY's parent company, confirmed the compromise.</p>\n<p>In response to the breach, Twin America has taken several steps to enhance data security, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changing all administrative-level passwords to more complex ones.</li>\n<li>Restricting access to the administration panel and server to a few pre-approved IP addresses.</li>\n<li>Patching scripting vulnerabilities and setting up an application firewall.</li>\n<li>Reconfiguring systems to ensure future transactions are processed without storing credit card data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Twin America has also notified affected customers, offering them a one-year free membership to a credit monitoring service and a 50% discount coupon for a tour. However, they made a significant mistake by attaching the discount coupon code to the breach notification letter published by New Hampshire's attorney general. The coupon code, \"012345,\" is simple to guess and now widely known, as it was included in the published letter. This oversight highlights the need for the company to take information security more seriously.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"

These systems are commonly used to manage water supplies, power plants, and other industrial facilities, making the worm particularly dangerous for governments.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The Hacker News\" data-src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheGHi9uqJRLwG33ZBN1W4Ohzhmkqh3HLzoSGTQk6QFjHWAOPSzZfWP2Z0jvnQxU9E80HQYicExKn5wuKPvd6M581RAolEvDm7nIoHyPj83hJxl78PeyBT8shPNO35Fy5FvbWVcvqjjV7w/s640/virus20sign1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\"/></p>\n<h2>Who Wrote This Program?</h2>\n<p>Experts in cybersecurity speculate that Stuxnet may have been created by a government or a well-financed group of investors. The virus is too complex to be the work of a single hacker. Given that much of the damage occurred in Iran, many believe Stuxnet was designed to sabotage the country\u2019s nuclear facilities.</p>\n<h2>Cyber-Attacks Getting More Sophisticated</h2>\n<p>Even if Stuxnet wasn't targeting U.S. infrastructure, its creation marks a new wave of cyberattacks. These attacks, including viruses and malware, aim at infrastructure such as power-generating facilities. This shift means we must now worry about more sophisticated threats, not just the defacement of web pages. Governments need to be prepared for attacks on valuable assets.</p>\n<h2>Can Stuxnet Infect Home Computers?</h2>\n<p>\"Aurora had a zero-day, but it was a zero-day against Internet Explorer version 6,\" he said. \"Here you have a vulnerability effective against every version of Windows since Windows 2000.\" Microsoft no longer supports Windows 2000 and other older versions still heavily used in ICS applications. Stuxnet can exploit MS08-067, the same vulnerability used by Downadup (a.k.a. Conficker), to spread. MS08-067 is a critical vulnerability in the Windows Server Service on Windows 2008/Vista/2003/XP/2000 computers, allowing hackers to gain remote control with the same privileges as a logged-on user.</p>\n<h2>Patches, Fixes, and Antivirus Available</h2>\n<p>Stuxnet targets physical processes, making it unpatchable. Detecting a sophisticated cyber attack aimed at ICSs is challenging for the ICS community. IT malware researchers have the best chance of identifying it. Therefore, collaboration between the ICS and IT communities is crucial. The ICS community needs to learn how to detect Stuxnet infections to ensure the reliability of control systems.</p>\n<p>The only sensible advice regarding this virus is to have backup plans ready in case your system is affected.</p>\n<br/>\n\n\n"
